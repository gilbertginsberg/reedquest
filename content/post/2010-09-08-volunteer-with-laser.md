Want to get outside the bubble? Want to volunteer? Have federal work study (or not)? Like working with kids? Then you should check out LASER!

LASER stands for Lane After School Education with Reed. This SEEDS program places Reedies in Lane Middle School as after school mentors or classroom interns. Lane is located just 2 miles southeast of Reed, 87% of Lane’s student body is in the free or reduced lunch program, and Lane’s mascot is a quasar (how cool is that?!) Spend a few hours every week getting classroom experience, volunteering with kids, learning about Portland Public Schools, and getting VOLUNTEER EXPERIENCE or WORK STUDY MONEY, and PIZZA. If interested, contact [Kelsey Lucas][1]  or [Kirsten Mandala][2] for more information and applications.
