_**From the 1982 Student Handbook**_ 

The Old Reed was still going strong just a few years ago. It was a place where people could hang out, where comfortable was the big word, and where the Caucus came just that close to bankrupt. Jack Dudman, Robert Segel, The Doyle Owl, Free drugs at Renn Fayre, The Coffee House, Getting in free to the annual porn flick by going nude, Questing and Answer sessions after Hum lectures, Mailroom socials, Ronnie Geller, Aerbolingus, Hard Liquor Socials, and the Frigidaire – all Old Reed.

New Reed comprises about 80% of what you will experience this year. The distinctive aspects of Reed are falling by the wayside – Go look at old catalogs and admissions brochures. New Reed is tightly organized, bureaucratized, and functionally oriented. It is now more important for the grass to remain undriven upon than it is to smoke it.

New Reed isn’t necessarily all bad. Things can and do run a bit smoother, but some of the charm, magic and warmth is lost along the way. It’s quite possible that I’m a conservative old sentimentalist who never wants to see things change, but there have been new additions to this place which are Old Reed in nature: the swingset, outdoor socials and Renn Fayre bands, the Hawaiin wave, Women’s Rugby, and the Creative Anarchists’ Guild, for example. What I object to is the drift away from fun, and being able to fuck up, and people-orientation to a movement involving social sobriety, all-encompassing efficiency and system-orientation.

Old Reed still exists – scroungers, KRRC, Socials, Westwind (although it may all be lost by the time you read this), but it’s slowly withering away.

It’s funny, but the Honor Principle really used to work in Old Reed. In-class tests were unheard of, thefts were rare and people were, in general, more tolerant of each other. But as the outside world has changed so have we, and our singular code of conduct has not worked so well in recent history.

So where does this leave you? Ask people about how things used to be, challenge the system, experience new things, go to the chem lab and create new drugs, learn the lyrics of The Pancake Song, put a sandbox around the swingset or&#8230;??!!?? Most of all, have fun – I did.
