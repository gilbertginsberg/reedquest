</p>

In the 1990s, development economist Amartya Sen formulated a controversial theory. He postulated that countries that have a free press and competitive elections are better at averting famines, and he used events in Ethiopia, Sudan, Botsawana, and Zimbabwe to prove his point. Using the same countries as Sen, and incorporating three additional African countries, Political Science major Danny Sellers ’13 will seek to challenge this theory.

Danny, who hails from Washington, D.C., is working on his 75-page thesis with Professor Mariela Szwarcberg. He says that Sen experienced the Great Bengal Famine of 1943, in which there was plenty of food, but the population did not have enough money to buy it. “After India became independent, various democratic institutions were instated that allowed it to avoid famine, or at least avert famine caused by the same causes that had catalyzed the Bengal famine,” says Danny.

“Nobody knew about the famine outside the area where it was happening, so the government was not at all accountable to the people, especially the poorer people in this one province who were victims,” Danny explains, which led to the free press component of Sen’s argument.

Danny says that Sen then reformulated the theory to fit certain African countries in the 1980s. According to Danny, this reformulation “in and of itself presents difficulties, because obviously India and the countries he looked at are not the same.”

In Sen’s original theory, Ethiopia and Sudan, both of which experienced famines, exemplified countries without free press or competitive elections. Botswana and Zimbabwe were nominally democratic and did not experience famine.

“But in Zimbabwe they did have famine,” said Danny, “it just was not publicized. And in Botswana, the free press and competitive elections were questionable at best. And then in Sudan and Ethiopia there were also elections. So none of them is really as clear-cut a case as the original theory would lead a reader to believe.”

In fact, Danny’s thesis uses historical narratives to show that Sen’s theory does not hold true in several African countries in the 1980s. Danny gives the counterexample of Kenya, “which in 1984 was a single-party state for thirty years and had a heavily-regulated press. And yet, when the rain stopped, the president basically single-handedly mobilized the resources necessary to avert famine.”

Danny says that while famine is the topic of his thesis, the historical narratives are actually tangential to the question “So What?” Danny says the answer to that question is about accountability.

“In countries where you have no free press and no free elections, not only is there no accountability, but there’s also no incentive to be accountable,” says Danny. “So there’s no reason for a government to spend more money and get itself embroiled in all the politics trying to secure aid and provide it to a marginalized population if they don’t have to.”

This would prove Sen’s theory right, says Danny, except that “free press and competitive elections are sufficient but not necessary to avert famine,” which the case in Kenya proves. “If you extrapolate Sen’s theory to ‘Institutions which promote accountability yield a government which can avert famine,’ that’s basically a tautology because you have ‘Accountability yields accountability.’ But that’s kind of what it amounts to,” Danny explains.

Danny says that he chose this topic based on a general interest of his. “I think the global food system is interesting and kind of fucked up. Everyone tries to compete on this market that is not only unfair but deliberately so, at least from the perspective of some people,” he explains.
