In this semester’s election, 54% of the student body voted, a major improvement over the previous semester.  Critically, sufficient numbers voted “yes” on the proposed amendment to the Community Constitution that will allow the Judicial Board code reforms, which create a new Sexual Misconduct Board, to be enacted.  Paul Hovda, chair of the Community Affairs Committee and professor of philosophy, called it “a very important vote.  It insured that our Community Constitution is in line with the new Judicial Board Code.”

The race for student body president was decided in favor of Brian Moore ’13 over Sarah Carlisle ’13.  Excluding votes for write-ins, quorum, and no quorum, Moore won over 60% of the vote, with almost 400 votes.  Carlisle had emphasized her experience on Senate during the campaign, while Moore had focused on his understanding of the Honor Principle based on his experience with Honor Council.  Looking back on the election, Moore praised Carlisle’s campaigning skills: “Sarah should be commended for running a really strong campaign.”  He mentioned that many people had difficulty choosing whom to vote for, “which speaks to the strength of the pool of candidates this semester.”  Carlisle, who will continue as a senator during next semester, admitted that she was “surprised by the all of the results of the election.”  Nonetheless, she described the newly-elected candidates as “hardworking and thoughtful individuals . . . I am looking forward to working with them.”

Both winning and losing candidates for Senate were in relatively good spirits.  Shabab Ahmed Mirza ’13, who came in first place in the senatorial race, expressed his pleasure with “the strength and diversity of the candidates this year.”  Losing candidate Paul Messick ’15 was also positive about those who won: “Everyone who won deserves to be a part of our Senate.”  Sean Howard ‘13, who also ran unsuccessfully for Senate, offered a similar take: “I think the candidates that won deserved to win.”  Alex Gersovitz ’12, however, was somewhat more negative: “It would have been more awesome if I won.”

Interestingly, almost all of candidates elected this year are social science majors.  The only exception was Aidan Sigman &#8217;13, who ran unopposed for vice president and who is a philosophy major.  Two of the senators-elect, Mirza and Marie Perez ’12, and the president-elect are economics majors.  The two other senators-elect are also majoring in the social sciences: Ari Galper ’14 in sociology, and John Iselin ’14 in political science.  Why was this the case? For one thing, the candidates included many social science majors: At least two other economics majors and one political science major were among the losing candidates for Senate.  In addition, Mirza noted that he had switched majors from religion-theater to economics partly “so that I would have more time to take part in non-academic things.”  In contrast, the four senators elected last semester included one chemistry major (Dana Loutey ’12) and one English major (Carlisle).

For Quest Board, ConQuest 2.0 successfully defeated its major rival, No Quorum.
