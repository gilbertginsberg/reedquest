According to Townsend Angell, director of facilities and grounds at Reed, being on campus during an earthquake might be safer than previously thought. He says that he would rather be in any building on campus than in one of the towers in downtown Portland. Although the newest buildings are safest by current standards, because the standards change each time there’s an earthquake, building standards might be outdated; thus, it’s important to continually improve the safety of buildings as time and budget allow. Buildings on campus have been and are routinely retrofitted to ensure that they measure up to the standards of the given time. Moreover, unified connecting structures, seismic joints placed where two buildings come together and other modes of anchoring are found throughout edifices on campus.

In Angell’s twenty years of working at Reed, the only earthquake-related damage he’s seen is that of the lateral splits on the exposed trusses that hold up the roof of the sports center, a tilt-up building. Since most of the structures at Reed aren’t particularly tall, a more serious hazard is being outside during an earthquake since stone buildings, like Old Dorm Block and Elliot Hall, would likely have pieces fall off of them. Reed has predetermined methods of notification and communication in case of emergency, a hierarchy of “who’s in charge” during incidence response, as well as an emergency response team that meets regularly to discuss possible incidents on campus, from earthquakes to the spread of infectious diseases. In fact, if there were catastrophic seismic activity, Reed would probably serve as a shelter since the larger buildings are capable of holding a sizeable amount of people and would likely withstand tremors.

Vibrations from earthquakes vary depending on the way they hit; earthquake avoidance procedures look at what happened after the fact, thus producing building codes in locations of seismic activity.

“Although people seem to take [the threat of seismic activity] seriously here, the prospect is different when you recognize a threat as opposed to when you experience it,” said Angell.  For example, “Commons is obligated and willing to have three days of food for the whole campus [in case] we were cut off from food supplies, as well as water and other capacities if water lines were interrupted, if trucks couldn’t get here, etc.”

And for those concerned about what would happen to the reactor if there were an earthquake, there’s no need to fret: “it’s very unlikely that it would rupture,” said Angell, “and doesn’t present a threat to anyone because of its small size.”

According to Chris Goldfinger, professor of marine geology and geophysics at Oregon State University, the Northwest is dangerously unprepared for a devastating earthquake. Not only does Oregon lack seismic requirements for dams and store liquid fuel in tanks on soil susceptible to liquefaction along the Willamette River, but much of Portland’s bridges and unreinforced masonry structures are prone to collapse; many of them don’t meet current earthquake standards.

The Northwest’s Cascadia Subduction Zone, a fault where the Juan de Fuca Plate is pushed under the North American plate, hasn’t shifted significantly since 1700, at which time, according to geological evidence, an estimated 9-magnitude earthquake occurred and sent a tsunami whose 50 to 60 foot waves hit Japan. The past 300 years of largely inactive plates has aroused concern for regional experts who say that within the next 50 years, “Washington and northern Oregon face a 10 to 15 percent probability of an offshore quake powerful enough to kill thousands and launch a tsunami that would level coastal cities” (Read, _The Oregonian_). Since the Northwest isn’t particularly prone to such climactic activity, it’s important to assess both Portland’s and Reed’s levels of preparedness in light of seismic activity.
