  As a student who worked hard to help bring Dr. Mary Poplin to campus, I was disturbed by <a title="Letters: Smoking and Secularism" href="http://www.reedquest.org/2012/11/letters-smoking-and-secularism/">Thomas Willingham&#8217;s response</a> to your article, &#8220;<a title="Is Secularism an Obstacle in the Search for Truth?" href="http://www.reedquest.org/2012/11/secularism-as-an-obstacle-in-the-search-for-truth/">Is Secularism An Obstacle in the Search for Truth?</a>&#8220;. I believe it was an unfair extrapolation of a fairly short article into a religious straw man argument. Thomas, while I understand that perhaps the article was unclear, I feel compelled to address some of the issues you bring up in hopes of clarifying what she said at her lecture.

  First, Dr. Poplin&#8217;s contention that modern secularism bankrupts the University addressed the elite institutions that drive Western society – e.g. Harvard, Yale, Oxford, (Reed?), etc. What she argued was not that universities should revert to an educational framework that involves <em>only </em>Christian thought, but that religious approaches to theoretical problems have been shoved to the margins at most elite Western universities. In doing so, secularism at the modern university actually contradicts its own premises of tolerance and openness.

    Second, you criticize her contention that we are largely ignorant of what the world believes, pointing out that being nonreligious is not the same thing as being ignorant of religion. I agree with this assessment, but I will also point out that this was not Dr. Poplin&#8217;s argument. She did not say that <em>being </em>nonreligious makes one ignorant of religion, but that elite, ivory-tower universities and liberal arts colleges (such as our own) are largely insulated from the beliefs of most people who live in the world today. This builds on the first point. The current secular framework in most elite universities marginalizes religious idea systems, giving us an incomplete picture of the intellectual fields that are available to us. I would also note that while Dr. Poplin&#8217;s argument focused on her experience in applying a Judeo-Christian framework to her field of educational studies, she says that this is equally true for other religious traditions.

    Third, you dismiss her story about Mother Teresa by characterizing her argument as &#8220;Mother Teresa, therefore Christianity good.&#8221; Again, this was not her argument. Her story about Mother Teresa was not a simple equation between Christianity and morality. Rather, she made the point that her experiences working for the Missionaries of Charity in Kolkata shattered her previous pedagogical framework, because Mother Teresa&#8217;s service through her love for Jesus (and she talks about Jesus <em>a lot</em>) could not be explained away through only a secular lens.

    Dr. Poplin&#8217;s lecture is available on the website of <a href="http://www.veritas.org">The Veritas Forum</a>, and she has published a book on her time in Kolkata. I encourage you or any other curious parties to visit their website and watch it in its entirety and/or read her book. If you have specific complaints about her argument, you are then free to contact her and follow-up. She&#8217;s actually super nice.

    Finally, I ask that you reconsider the language which with you level your criticisms. You are, of course, free to vehemently disagree with Mary Poplin&#8217;s Christian views (or anybody&#8217;s, for that matter). But calling her names like &#8220;Mary Poppins Poplin&#8221;, and dismissing Christian thought as &#8220;magical thinking&#8221; runs counter to the ideal of open and honorable discourse that we hold so dear. Maybe that last point is debatable, but at the very least I found it neither respectful nor productive.
