That’s Burlesque in a nutshell. Running at an hour and a half, Burlesque is the perfect escape from end-of-the-semester blues. It isn’t much more than that, though.

Cher plays Tess, the fiercely independent owner of the Burlesque Lounge who can’t seem to accept the fact that her best friend, Sean, likes dick – not her. Stanley Tucci plays Sean, who is basically the love-child of Nigel from The Devil Wears Prada (also played by Stanly Tucci) and Julia Child’s practically gay husband, Paul, from Julie and Julia (played by Tucci as well). Christina Aguilera plays Ali, the feisty, no-nonsense waitress from Iowa turned waitress in LA turned burlesque star/homewrecker/gold-digger/role-model for teenaged girls. While Tess tries to figure out how to save herself from bankruptcy, Ali concerns herself with becoming a \*~\*~~StAr~~\*~\*. In the end, they help each other out (Psst, that’s the twist).

Doctor McSteamy plays Ali’s playboy villain boyfriend and Cam Gigandet of Twilight/The O.C. fame, plays her sultry engaged-to-a-girl-on-the-east-coast roommate come boyfriend. Rounding out the cast is Alan Cumming who reprises his role as the emcee from the 1998 Broadway revival of Cabaret, throwing in an instrumental rendition of “Two Ladies” for good measure.

In that vein, Burlesque borrows liberally from both Cabaret and Chicago. Like I said, this movie wins points for being a moderately entertaining distraction, not for originality. Furthermore, Christina is constantly stealing outfits and hairdos from Lady Gaga and T-Swizzle in an attempt to get the audience to subconsciously associate her with success.

As for the soundtrack, Cher’s voice is wasted on a song straight out of the Yiddish version of Cabaret and a sappy ballad that tries all too hard to recapture classic warrior Cher. Aguilera, on the other hand, monopolizes the soundtrack with touchdown after homerun after slamdunk.

The cleverest song is “But I’m a Good Girl,” in which Christina Aguilera insinuates she sleeps with men for material goods but is offended by the conclusions you’re drawing while she dances like sex-crazed peacock.

Bottom line: Burlesque is definitely worth the $11 ticket at least once, if only because it’s got the potential to fuel a conversation about the decline of American cinema/gender as a performance/Stanley Tucci for a couple of hours. Whether you decide to go sober is up to you, though.
