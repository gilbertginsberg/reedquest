The direktors tout that Hum Play this is year will be &#8220;dirtier, raunchier, and uncircumcised, as it should be.&#8221; The show will be in Vollum Lecture Hall on April 26th at 7 p.m. A sub-free show will be the day before at 9 p.m. There is a one-butt per seat policy so students will be lining up early. Direktor Megan Finley says the wait is worth it because &#8220;Peter Steinberger said that &#8216;Hum Play keeps the original feeling behind Renn Fayre alive.'&#8221;

The actors are all freshman and the direktors are all Hum Play actors from last year. They are Megan Finley &#8217;15, Meghan Comer &#8217;15, Ray Zuniga &#8217;15, Madeline Resse &#8217;15, and Alex McCracken &#8217;15. Zuniga says that &#8220;the first rule of Hum Play is you don&#8217;t talk about Hum Play.&#8221; The play hasn&#8217;t changed much from its first production in 1994 by Political Science major Greg Lam ’96. It follows the odyssey of the Student as he travels through the Hum 110 syllabus.

However, the syllabus has changed since 1994 and the script has changed a little as well. Comer says, &#8220;We are upholding the tradition and turning it on its head.&#8221; Zuniga says that this year&#8217;s play &#8220;is fairly Nü Reed. It&#8217;s the last Nü Reed before Nü Nü Reed.&#8221; Noting the big change in the syllabus next year, the direktors calmly say, &#8220;that&#8217;s next year&#8217;s problem.&#8221; They do leave words of advice for next year&#8217;s direktors though. &#8220;If you repeat something enough, it&#8217;ll be funny,&#8221; and noted that &#8220;this shit writes itself.&#8221;

The direktors say that there will be many fun cameos this year. There will be new favorites and old favorites. They also express deeply missing the presence of Philosophy Professor Paul Hovda. At the end of the day, it is a celebration of Hum 110. &#8220;It&#8217;s like a last minute really sexy study aid,&#8221; says Zuniga. &#8220;You might say that this Hum Play takes place in a Nü World.&#8221;
