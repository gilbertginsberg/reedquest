There are nights at our fair school, dark, dark nights, when, listening to the sound of the rain on your roof and how it synchronizes with the drip-dripping of your tears onto your laptop keyboard, and meditating on the four hundred pages you have to read by tomorrow, you get hungry. And do you know what I do on those nights, Reed College? Well, I&#8217;ll tell you.

First, I go to my freezer and discover that all that it contains is a giant box of ancient frozen corndogs. Then I think back to my desk and the deep evil mounded on top of it in the form of homework (read: my life), and I say &#8220;fuck it, I need some ice cream.&#8221; So I get on my bike and ride to Safeway, and when I get back—ice cream tucked safely under my arm—here&#8217;s what I do.

I find an apple (&#8220;What?&#8221; I hear you say. &#8220;If you had apples, why didn&#8217;t you just eat an apple?&#8221; BECAUSE I&#8217;M CRYING INSIDE IS WHY.) and cut it into slices as thin as possible, while heating up a tablespoonish of butter in a frying pan. Then I put the apples in said butter, cook a minute or two over medium heat, and add a tablespoonish of brown sugar and some cinnamon. Cook another few moments. Then, and this is the good part, pour a splash, or two, why not? of brandy, whiskey, or rum in there and light it on FIRE. Yes, fire. If you decide to try this, dear Reedie, you might want to have a grownup help you with that part. Anyway, I wait until the fire goes out and then I scrape it all onto a bowl of ice cream that has been anxiously waiting for just such a buttery-spicy-boozy friend.

I then proceed to eat my feelings.

_Trivia: you can do this with any kind of fruit; I find it&#8217;s particularly great with peaches. Regarding the liquor, I tend to use cognac because I think of myself as a classy lady, but any brownish one would do. Vodka probably wouldn&#8217;t add anything. Gin or tequila would, I imagine, be pretty foul, but hey, this is America and you can do what you want._
