To be eligible for a Lottery Mac you must be either a thesising senior or on financial aid. Also, so that we can make these computers available to those most in need, students who already own a working computer are kindly asked not to apply for the lottery. This program is based on the Honor Principle and intended to help those in need.

Still interested? You’ll need to complete a Lottery Application Form and turn it into the IRC Help Desk, Computer Hardware Shop (ETC 114) or the Computer Store (ETC 116).
