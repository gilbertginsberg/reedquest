How does a cell decide what it’s going to be when it “grows up”? Just like when you choose your major or thesis topic, your cells make decisions that impact their futures. Each immature cell in a developing brain is full of unlimited possibilities. Over time, the cell hears particular signals and makes specific choices, all of which combine to influences its ultimate “career choice.”

Recently, biologists and mathematicians at Cambridge University worked together to learn how progenitor cells makes decisions to give rise to neurons in the developing retina (the light sensing part of the eye that is part of the brain). The biologists first gleaned insights about how cells make decisions by using a process called photoconversion. Photoconversion permanently switches a fluorescent protein from one color to another. In this paper, the authors first engineered fish eyes that could express a photoconvertible protein, called Kaede. Kaede is a fluorescent protein produced in nature by a single species of stony coral. It was first discovered by a research group in Japan, who aptly named the protein after maple leaves (called Kaede in Japanese) that change from green to red in the autumn.

The authors next activated Kaede expression in a subset of progenitor cells in the retina, so that they glowed green. Then at particular times during eye development, they shone a UV laser on a single green-glowing cell, turning it red. Photoconverting a single green-glowing progenitor allows the scientists to watch the single cell divide and differentiate into specific types of neurons, generating a family of red neurons among a sea of green.

Based on the photoconversion data, the mathematicians built models to assess whether progenitors make stochastic decisions about their fate or follow a more deterministic path. A well-established model holds that generations of daughter cells go through a series of different stages, each of which determines what type of cell the progenitor is able to become. Here’s how this model could work in real life: Imagine you’re a wandering salesperson. First, you sell watches. Soon, everyone has a watch and even Reedies arrive on time. Next, you move on to selling microbrews, then Alpaca fiber socks. You’re now rich enough to retire, you scrap the whole project, and there exists a plethora of tipsy, though punctual, people, all of whom have awesome socks. Were this scenario to occur in retinas, progenitors first produce one type of neuron (like the light sensitive photoreceptors) and then alter their internal programs to begin making another type of neuron (like the glial cells that support and nourish the retina). Controlling such a feat is quite an accomplishment for a little ball of cytoplasm.  The new study argues for a simpler model, with stochasticity ordering the generation of neurons. Essentially, the model proposes that you start out with a backyard full of watches, micro brews, and socks; and chiefly by chance you decide what to sell each day.

    Evidence supporting a stochastic model of retinal cell differentiation. In the middle of the figure, small vertical bands&#8211;which describe the particular lineage path an individual cell took&#8211;are grouped together horizontally based on the similarity of their lineage paths. Different colors indicate different cell types. On the bottom of the bars is a tree of how you might expect cell lineages to branch off assuming that sister cells might follow similar lineage paths. The top lines show the cells that were actually produced from sister lineages, indicating much greater complexity.<br />Figure reprinted from Neuron, 75(5), Jie He, et al., How variable clones build an invariant retina, pp. 786-796, Copyright © 2012, with permission from Elsevier.

The authors collected examples of many cell lineages and used it to construct a model. They went on to show that the model accurately describes their data (not all that surprising since they did, after all, design their model to fit their data). As the authors admit, it’s extremely difficult to prove randomness and stochasticty. Consider a string of numbers. Is the pattern random, or have you just not looked at enough numbers to discern the pattern? Similarly, although the cells’ behaviors seem random at this level of analysis, what happens when the cell behaviors are inspected more closely or when more lineages are examined? While the model describes the data in the paper, it doesn’t have any predictive powers. We were hoping for more and will be interested to learn whether this stochastic model inspires new studies or simply closes the book on how cells differentiate.
