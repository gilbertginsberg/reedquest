The eclectic sounds of the KRRC may soon be returning to the airwaves with its very own FM radio station. Thanks to Obama’s initiative, “The Local Community Radio Act of 2010,” there is now FM radio space available for non-profits and educational institutions who apply and are approved. Senate has allotted Reed’s radio station $10,400 for the purchase and installation of a transmitter, antenna, and emergency alert system as long as KRRC’s application for a Low Power FM, or LPFM, frequency and license is accepted this month. Funds will be taken out of the interest accrued by the school’s endowment instead of from student body funds.

KRRC will be competing with other Portland-based stations vying for one of six available LPFM frequencies. The application should open on October 15, but the Federal Communications Committee could potentially close the window a day before the designated application period, preventing KRRC from even applying for a frequency. Given the current government shutdown, the FCC is ceasing all nonessential duties, which could complicate the LPFM application process.

KRRC has had a transient and inconsistent history. The station lost its last broadcasting license in November of 2011, after being on air in various forms since 1955. The last frequency went to a larger commercial station. If KRRC is approved to go back on air, it would be the only liberal arts school in the country with an LPFM channel.

In his proposal to Senate, station manager John Pape (also known as DJ PEE) wrote of the benefits of an LPFM station. Broadcasting, he wrote, would create “an inclusive communal power—any student can turn on their radio and listen—that completely severs social boundaries.” The new format would add “a level of power and also responsibility” to the Reed community. Along with the potential FM-related changes, Pape plans on buying new microphones and employing a general manager, a studio engineer, and a music librarian in the spring.

If the application for LPFM is approved, DJs would still be able to play uncensored shows in the same manner they do now, by streaming over the station’s website, krrcfm.com. DJs hoping to broadcast on air, however, would undergo an application and review process. Mike Johnson, owner of the nearby Mountain Air Studios, has offered to be an advisor to the station, and he, along with the station manager, would review shows before authorizing any DJ to move on air. This process would also cut down FCC fines, which were an issue for the station in the past.

There’s one message Pape has for the Reed Community: legal advice could be invaluable in the coming weeks. If anyone has a parent or friend who’s a lawyer, consider getting in touch with him.  The LPFM application will be complicated to complete and, although Pape says he is “happy that the proposal has made it this far, the real struggle” he said, “will be convincing the government to give us another shot.”
