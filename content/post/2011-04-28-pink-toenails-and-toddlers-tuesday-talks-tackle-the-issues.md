This week at the Multicultural Resource Center (MRC), students dropped by during their lunch hour for a Tuesday Talk on “Pink Nail Polish and the Internet’s Long Memory.” The talk began with a short video on the recent controversy over the photo of a mother painting her 5 year old son’s toenails in a J. Crew catalog, followed by a discussion of the criticism directed at the catalog in the media. The casual atmosphere made it easy for a newcomer to join the conversation, though the participants did not hesitate to touch on contentious issues like parental responsibility and “the fabric of masculinity.”

Organized by MRC student interns Nabeel Arshad, Soudea Forbes, Kristy Fullerton and Louis Melendez, Tuesday Talks are a forum for conversation about social justice issues. Past topics have included the Tea Party movement, sexual assault at Reed, gendered Halloween costumes and Kanye West’s Twitter. Specific members of the community have also been invited to Tuesday Talks to field questions on areas they work in, such as the discussion on the push to get gender neutral restrooms on campus.

As with a lot of other forums at Reed, discussion has been known to get heated. “Reedies are very opinionated people,” says a sophomore who attended several Tuesday Talks. “Sometimes, they bite.”

Forbes assures that this should not deter someone from attending a Tuesday Talk. “The interns are trained to make sure that it’s a safe space for everyone. We try to make sure everyone gets heard.”

Interested students can also apply to be an MRC intern for the 2011/12 academic year. Contact Bruce Smith ([&#x73;&#x6d;&#x69;&#x74;&#x68;&#x62;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][1]) for an application or more information.

The final Tuesday Talk of the semester is on 5/3 at noon on the SEEDS Alternative Spring Break. Bring your lunch!
