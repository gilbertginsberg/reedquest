Red alders bow over the water and the sun glints through the crown of a tall Douglas fir. A great blue heron descends in silence on a half submerged log, where it stands erect, unmoving on its spindly legs. Nearby, an otter’s oily coat gleams as it emerges from the water, hastily dipping back beneath the surface in search of salmon. The scene could have taken place hundreds of years ago in the unsettled Willamette river valley, but these days, it continues to occur, even in the midst of urban Portland, Oregon, at a part of the Johnson Creek Watershed that we know as the Reed Canyon. It is striking at dusk and glorious at the height of a sunny day, but my favorite time there is undoubtedly dawn, when it is still, and the angle of the light hits the motionless water in that way that makes it look like liquid metal. Sun, however, is not requisite to take pleasure in the canyon (and that’s a damn good thing, too). On a cool, drizzling day, certain misty spots seem to alter space and time for a moment, making one feel far from Reed, far from Portland, far from the 21<sup>st</sup> century altogether—and on occasion, that sense of respite and humility is important.

But despite the sense of wildness that the canyon sometimes exudes, its human presence is a vital component of the space, with regards to both its ecological function and visual appeal. The 28 acres that run through the center of campus are marked by that distinctive aesthetic that occurs when the spheres of humanity and “nature” have begun to merge deliberately and effectively, which in the canyon’s case has been largely due to restoration efforts over the past couple decades. This unique element of the canyon permeates so many parts of the space—it is present in the network of trails that wind through native ferns and grasses, in the fish ladder that allows steelhead and salmon passage from the lake to the lower creek, in the sound of students arguing about post-modern literary theory mingling with the sound of mallards quacking loudly (two sounds which are actually equally irritating). But really—the canyon serves as an example of a landscape where the boundary between human and non-human has been collapsed successfully. It is a wild garden, the likes of which post-romantic environmentalists and urban ecologists would be proud.

Come help the Reed community maintain and enjoy this exceptional area on Canyon Day, which will take place on Saturday, Oct. 5, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. The event is free, open to all ages, and will be located in the corner of the canyon just below the Grove dorms, near the Canyon House. In addition to tools, training, food, and fun, there will also be live musicians and cider pressing—you really shouldn’t miss it.
