“This place has grown on me like a fungus,” says graffiti on the KRRC station’s walls, “and I’m allergic to penicillin.” The line captures one Reedie’s love for KRRC, and in light of the station’s recent rise to the seventh slot on this semester’s Funding Poll Top 40, it’s clear that K-Rock has grown on Reed like a fungus, too.

More than thirty people showed up in KRRC’s colorfully graffitied station in the Student Union to be trained as DJs last Friday, and close to a dozen more attended training on Saturday. “People were frustrated that they couldn’t get involved,” said signator and station manager Rose Lewis ’13, “and, now that they can get involved, we can use all this energy.” KRRC is moving to an entirely online format through Live 365, a censorship-free online streaming service that KRRC used last year. Lewis was enthusiastic about the change.

KRRC lost its broadcasting license in November after Reed turned in the license to the FCC. The station lost its frequency to a larger broadcaster, and had faced challenges from larger stations in the past. All of Portland’s frequencies are occupied. In the past twelve years, “we’ve never been in compliance with the FCC,” said Lewis. “There was kind of no way to get out of the non-compliance trap.” After spending more than fifty years on the air, recording The Kinks live in 1968, and leading alumnus Barry Hansen ’63 to his radio career as Dr. Demento, KRRC’s transmitter is silent. “I did as much as I possibly could to get us back on the air if there was any possible way, but there’s just not,” said Josie Aris ’13, station co-manager. Lewis said on _The Quest_ website in December, “I can confidently state that the transition to an online format by no means signals the death of KRRC, merely its reincarnation in a more accessible form. Last year we garnered far more listeners through streaming than through actual airplay and, as an added benefit, the money saved on legal fees can be used for further improvements to the station.”

Reed worked with the FCC to donate the license to Common Frequency, a non-profit dedicated to grassroots radio. While the old license’s frequency is now occupied by a larger broadcaster in Portland, Common Frequency is seeking possible uses elsewhere. “Now we’re looking at trying to set up a really low-power broadcast that would cover just the campus because we could do that unlicensed, and that would be legal,” said Aris. “There’s a chance we could get even a mile off campus with, still, no need for a license.”

A steam pipe under the station’s floor burst shortly before fall break last semester, wiping graffiti from two of the station’s walls and damaging some of KRRC’s library. The library, composed of twenty-nine color-coded genres, is housed in a musty room adjacent to the station, and contains over thirty thousand records on plywood shelves and hundreds, if not thousands, of CDs. Jon Pape ’14, resident technical expert and DJ role model, said, “There’s a bunch of stuff in there that could buy a house.” Some of the 7” vinyl sleeves in the station’s library grew moldy following a flood several years ago and adhered to the records they were supposed to protect. “There are invaluable things, and they’re just lost,” said Aris. “There’s original pressings of so much that you can’t ever find. There are so many seven inches that I’ve never heard of it, and it’s rotten now, and it’s probably nowhere to be found.” Aris said KRRC hasn’t been adding to its collection of vinyl, but added, “If we can start to do that again, we would love to. We don’t really have the money right now.” Senate allocated $719 to KRRC last Thursday, fully meeting KRRC’s request. Lewis said the money would be used to pay for streaming, to buy new turntable needles and 7” vinyl sleeves, and for general station improvements.

Lewis briefly raised the possibility of reviving the tradition of printing KRRC schedules imposed on nude spreads of DJs and station managers in _The Quest_, and said she already had plans for her show this semester. “Mine is usually music that’s good to drink milkshakes with. So, probably a lot of punk and surf mostly, maybe some Bollywood thrown in there.” Pape said he would “probably be playing mostly Northwest music. Northwest in all shapes and forms of music and sound.”

According to a _Reed Magazine_ article written in 2002, KRRC got its start in 1954 as the Reed Radio Club. It wasn’t until October 1955 that the station debuted as KRCB-AM, “The Radio Voice of Reed College.” Operating out of the Doyle basement, KRCB moved to FM three years later. Though often off the air due to technical issues, KRCB persisted until 1979, when a more powerful broadcaster bumped KRCB from its original frequency. KRRC was reborn on 104.1 FM in 1981, which it lost to another station in 2002. The station moved again to 97.9 FM, the frequency it occupied until this year.
