On Sept. 14, sophomore Ben Steele walked out of his off-campus house to find a small piece of a U-lock with a jagged edge; his bike had been stolen. “I had already lost one bike on campus as a freshman,” says Steele. “My friends had been teasing me about locking this one to a tree, it’s possible that seeing it on a tree might have prompted the bike thief to steal it.”

“I didn’t really think much about it that day. I saw something on Reddit where a person tracked down a person on Craigslist and got their bike back. I checked Craigslist the next day, but didn’t see anything,” says Steele. “The second time I searched, I saw a hybrid 17-inch Trek bike listed with the same exact specifications as mine. It said ‘call Tony’ and listed a number.”

“I looked up the phone number, and he had posted a few different listings, using different names each time,” says Steele. “I called the CSOs and got all the information I had given them when I registered the bike.” He was instructed that the next thing he should do was get into contact with the Portland Police Bureau, because sometimes situations like that escalate.

“I called the non-emergency line,” says Steele. He though they would just take down his name, but they sent an officer to his house to talk to him in person. The cop said it was such a small incident that they were not going to pursue it any further, but said if he found the serial number matched he could contact the PPB again.

“I called the guy and we arranged to meet up,” says Steele. “When I called him, he said he was in Southeast Portland. I asked about the color of the bike and it was blue, just like mine.”

“We arranged to meet at the food cart pod at 52<sup>nd</sup> and Foster. He showed up riding a bike that was clearly not mine, but said he ‘wanted to make sure Ben wasn’t going to flake out.”

As promised, it was a Trek bike the same make model and size. “Where I had put on the Reed College bike sticker there was the torn off remains of a sticker,” says Steele. “It was from the Bike Gallery, where I bought my bike, he hadn’t bothered to even take that sticker off.”

Steele asked to take it for a test ride but never got out of sight to take a look at the serial number. Looking back, this would have been the opportunity to get his bike back. He could have just ridden off back to his house. Instead, he went back to the food carts and said he wasn’t sure if he wanted to buy the bike, but asked if they could meet the next day.

“I called the cops and arranged to meet the cops a little while before I met them,” Steele says. He was instructed to have the cops positioned nearby and call them when the guy arrived with the bike. The cops were late, and Steele decided to start walking over to the food cart pod because the meeting time had arrived.

“When I got about halfway down the block, wearing my bike helmet, a teenage girl came up to me and said, ‘Oh, you’re the one who wants to buy the bike, our neighbor’s riding it around right now,’” says Steele.

“The guy came up riding what appeared to be my bike, but then left, saying he had to tell his neighbor to not ride any of his bikes.” The cops rolled up after he had left.

“The cop came right up to me,” says Steele, “and I was just thinking, ‘wow, I hope this guy realizes what’s going on and doesn’t talk to me.’ But he walked right up to me and asked me where the guy was. I tried to explain to the teenage girls that I had just been saying ‘Hi’ to the cop but they asked if it was some kind of sting operation. The cop left, and obviously the bike thief was not going to be coming back.”

One of the girls had left her wallet behind, and Steele found out her name. From Facebook and Google searches he was able to uncover the identity of the bike thief. Steele found out he had so much of a record that an Oregonian article had been written about him a few years earlier. He had stolen a pick-up truck with two friends and they had gone to the Vollum estate to steal $81,000 of statuary and turn it into $264 worth of scrap metal that a police officer suggested might have been used for meth.

“We put the wallet back in a mailbox because we were worried about being in violation of the law, and weren’t really interested in dealing with this bike thief. The guy called me up and said the bike had been stolen and he couldn’t sell it to me,” says Steele. “Maybe it got turned into scrap metal for meth.”
