_**By Fossil Free Reed**_

Last Saturday four Reedies took to the roof of the PAB with a message for their community. The students and their banner remained on the roof for 40 minutes until negotiations with the CSOs came to a dead end. At the behest of the students, the CSOs made phone calls to request additional time on the building. After instructions to leave the roof became more stern, the students decided to descend to keep the situation from escalating.****

“We painted a banner, walked in the PAB, rode the freight elevator to the roof and sat down with our message hanging over the front of the building. It was Community Day on Saturday and the opening of the PAB so we hoped a lot of administrators, students, alums and community members would see it.” The message, dropped at 11:30am, took the form of a banner, inscribed with the words, “SUSTAINABILITY: Honor that endures.”  Scrawled underneath in smaller script were the terms “#divest” and “#draw the line”.

‘Divest’ is making a reference to current campaigns that colleges around the world are waging to divest from fossil fuel industries and reinvest in alternative solutions. The fossil fuel (coal, oil, gas) divestment movement is ****historically tied ****to the apartheid divestment movement in the 1980s and 90s that college students campaigned for across the country, including at Reed College. Currently, San Francisco State University Foundation, Hampshire College, Unity College, Sterling College, College of the Atlantic, and Green Mountain College have committed to fossil fuel-free investments. In addition, hundreds of fledgling divestment campaigns spearheaded by passionate student leaders are calling for their administrations to divest their endowments. Investing millions of dollars of endowment funds in corporations that are contributing to the global climate crisis resonates with students across the country as simply intolerable. With that said, students in higher education aren’t the only demographic interested in divestment. Eighteen cities across the country have committed to divesting city funds in fossil fuel companies, including Portland.

Charlie Hales, mayor of Portland, announced Portland’s commitment to divest at the 2013 North American World Environment Day: ****“The City must urge the Oregon State Treasurer, the Local Government Investment Pool and the Oregon Investment Council to divest of all state holdings in fossil fuel. ****Why take this seemingly risky investment strategy? Because NOT doing it is the truly risky move. The vast majority of fossil fuel assets are owned by 200 publicly traded companies. Eventually, these companies will burn through their entire reserves. We don’t know when that will happen, but by definition, we know that it must.”

‘Draw the Line’, also stamped on the students’ banner, is making a reference to the national movement, led by a group called 350, to draw the line against coal, oil, and gas extractive industries and exports. The 350 chapter in the Northwest opposes proposed coal export terminals and the transport of fossil fuels across the country from Montana and Wyoming, through the Northwest, ultimately for export internationally. Just one terminal would produce 48 million tons of coal annually. The toxic dust from the uncovered train cars transporting the coal would produce 500 lbs of dust per traincar_._ Check out 350.org, GrowDivestment, FossilFreeReed, and the Responsible Endowment Coalition for more information.

The relationship between fossil fuel industries’ proposal for coal terminals in the Northwest is strongly linked to dishonorable investments at colleges like Reed across the country. For this reason four students decided to take a stand last week to send a message to the Reed Community: We need to see climate change and sustainability as an issue of honor.

We encourage you, as Reed students who maintain the power to take action as a community, to have a personal stake in divestment and climate change issues here at the College. As we all well know, our conception of honor at Reed is “constantly redefined and kept alive by the community through our actions and continuous discussion. In consequence, its dynamic nature defies a particular satisfactory definition.”

From the mouth of one of the students involved in Saturday’s events: “We went onto the Performing Arts Building because, bound by honor and the intellectual honesty that Reedies value so highly, we do not think that the Reed community can continue to invest in companies that will ensure that we do not have a future. We wanted to open a space to discuss this issue and felt that a bit of political theatre __to inaugurate the new Performing Arts Building was in order.” More than this sentiment about divestment, however, it is important to see the vital necessity of taking action against climate change as a collective effort by our community.

In another vein, there are manifold ways to engage yourself: get involved with Reed’s beautiful community garden, fight for divestment, initiate an energy saving competition between dorms, expand composting on campus, talk to Commons about their food sources, get working animals on campus, collect and reuse grey water, build compostable toilets and talk, talk, talk about the reality of what matters to us as a critically thoughtful group about investments and honorable engagement with the world around us.****

If you are interested in divestment please email <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#x64;&#x69;&#x76;&#x65;&#x73;&#x74;&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x67;&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;</span>. We have weekly meetings specifically concerning divestment to plan the future of Reed’s campaign. I encourage you to come to future Greenboard meetings, occurring weekly at 5pm on Mondays in the Blue Heron Info Shop on the lower level of the GCCs. Greenboard can help connect you to both on and off-campus issues. Also, keep an eye out for weekly articles about what sustainability groups are actively doing on campus.
