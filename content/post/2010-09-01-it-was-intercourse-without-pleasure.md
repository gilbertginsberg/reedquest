_A Communique from the Reed Revolutionary Youth Brigade_

Can you say, &#8220;recuperation&#8221;?

We can, and we did on Friday evening at nine, when we were informed that Noise Parade had already taken place and no further marching would occur.

We can, and we did when we saw RKSK officials taking their cue from the CSOs and proclaiming via loudspeaker, in the finest spirit of collaboration, that it was time to go into the SU (and be in bed by 10 pm, no doubt!)

We can, and we did when we were told that the torches we were lighting in an attempt to restart the march had to be immediately extinguished (and shame of shames, the first person to inform us was not a CSO &#8211; after all it is their job &#8211; but a student).

We can, and we did when we saw fellow classmates detained and subjected to a humiliating lecture for lighting off a few pathetic fireworks in an attempt to restart the spectacle.

Let no one speak of the presence of the fire marshal, for in truth, we all know that it was only a pretext. We all know that in fact, such pretexts are eagerly seized to prove the &#8220;necessity&#8221; of a course that the administration is only too well-disposed to travel. What is essential is the determination to accelerate Reed&#8217;s transition (by any means at the disposal of the administration) to a placid society without &#8220;events.&#8221; The administration is preparing us for a society only superficially different from other schools, where what amounts to &#8220;reed culture&#8221; is that which has been robbed of its subversive and Dionysian side and is tolerated now only as a marketing ploy. It is preparing us to be &#8220;Noise Paraders&#8221; at 20 and smug, pretentious, self-satisfied, and centrist &#8220;Democrats&#8221; at 30. But we say that this SOCIETY is a PRISON.

The oft-cited need for a better relationship with the outside world is but a first line in a monologue that the administration murmurs like a monk in prayer. We all know what comes next: from the Honor Principle is deduced the need for student self-restraint (SELF-REPRESSION), for unity with the administration, and for total obedience to the CSOs, however much it robs the students of their creativity and spontaneity. &#8216;Honor&#8217; means that the student body must prostrate itself in the worship of all authority. &#8216;Honor&#8217; means that the student body must be solicitous to the point of SELF-ABNEGATION. Yet this bloody interpretation  of &#8220;Honor&#8221; reeks of repression. In the name of a retrograde &#8220;universal&#8221; ethics, the student body, and the student body alone, is taught that to save Reed, their own universe (that of autonomy and traditions) must be burned to the ground to make way for a new monolith as sleek and impersonal as SEQUOIA (a new dorm) and ten times as arrogant. It matters not the specifics of the case; all &#8220;traditions&#8221; must equally go out the window or be reduced merely to signifiers of what they once were. In this world, Reedies will repeatedly go through the motions of what is supposed to constitute a Life (work, eat, sleep, &#8220;play&#8221;, work, eat, sleep, &#8220;play&#8221; &#8211; and above all, WORK) without ever ascending to the Dionysian joy of true COLLECTIVE ACTION. This is the world that is prepared for us by the unrelenting initiatives of an administration that preaches social harmony and proceeds to liquidate our society to harmonize it.

But the student body is not fooled by all this talk of &#8220;saving Reed.&#8221; It sounds all too suspiciously like the paradox that &#8220;in order to save the Village, we had to destroy it.&#8221; The student realizes the essential difference between what she means by &#8220;Reed&#8221; and what the administration means; for the technocrats, who have forgotten what it means to live the interior of the student world, identify their institutions as Reed. They see in us only &#8220;Natives&#8221; to be colonized and &#8220;irresponsible children&#8221; to be disciplined. And the student instinctively knows that in the face of such paternalistic intransigence (&#8220;Don&#8217;t touch that! Don&#8217;t light that! Don&#8217;t eat that!&#8221;) there can be no true &#8220;dialogue,&#8221; only showy theater where both sides recite their lines and the play goes on in a predetermined manner. And what is more, they are well aware that at the end of the play, &#8220;peaceful coexistence&#8221; in the face of these provocations is impossible.

To be sure, Reedies recognize that many arms of this new administration are sympathetic to students; it is not a matter of throwing Molotov cocktails. But the student realizes that in this &#8220;peaceful coexistence&#8221; there is a violence &#8211; the violence of having to go through the perpetual motion of Reed Life without ever experiencing the sublimity of a REAL Noise Parade. For that was what was robbed to us on Friday night be the &#8220;cooperation&#8221; between RKSK and the CSOs &#8211; which in reality meant the utter capitulation of the students (as it always will) and the translation of Noise Parade into a sterile excercise devoid of what imbues it with meaning. It was intercourse without pleasure.

No! The students refuse to allow their moment to be taken from them! Even more so, they refuse to allow the latest generation of Reedies to go through this school believing that Noise Parade must end before 10 PM!

We demand true Dionysian revelry! We demand &#8211; and will have &#8211; collective satisfaction! Long live the STUDENT BODY!

Diver, the Dustbin of History awaits you!
