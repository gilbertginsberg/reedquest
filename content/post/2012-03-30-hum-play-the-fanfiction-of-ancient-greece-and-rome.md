“Hum Play is nothing but a cocaine dream,” joked Hum Play Direktor Gabbie Slaughter ’14 in one of many misleading comments about this year’s Hum Play. The play, which shows on April 13, is difficult to put into words. “[Professor] Wally Englert called it ‘Aristophanic,’” said Dean “Dad” Schmeltz ’14, another of this year’s direktors.

A few things about Hum Play are certain: It was first staged in 1994 by Political Science major Greg Lam ’96. It originated, Schmeltz explained, as part of Reed Arts Week. And it chronicles the journey of the Student, who travels through the Hum 110 syllabus in the course of one night.

The direktors of this year’s Hum Play, also including Ali Kafka ’14, Abby Dufresne ’14, and Andrew Douglas Watson I ’14, are as discreet as they are amusing. The only certain news they revealed is that Community Safety has asked for Vollum Lecture Hall to have a one-butt-per-seat policy. While in past years Hum Play audiences have filled Vollum to the brim, fire marshal complaints have caused Community Safety to request that the audience comply with fire safety codes. In order to accommodate the vast audience that Hum Play commands, “there will be an overflow room in Vollum,” Slaughter explained.

Otherwise, most of the details of Hum Play are shrouded in mystery. When asked about the process of revising Hum Play from year to year, Watson elusively commented, “Hum Play is a single living organism. It can only metamorphose, it can’t evolve.” Schmeltz clarified, “It’s changed a little bit every year. More jokes nowadays are about transcending the gender binary.”

Slaughter described the revision technique as one that is mostly left up to chance. “We just sit around in a circle and mutually masturbate and see what happens,” she explained. Added Watson, “We are the fanfiction writers of ancient Greece and Rome.”

This year’s Hum Play has taken on new challenges: It is the first year that the direktors have been taught to the new Hum 110 syllabus. With half the school having learned the old syllabus, the direktors had to appeal to both the old and new syllabi. “We probably did a better job of treating the new syllabus than last year’s direktors,” Schmeltz assured, “just because the old direktors didn’t ever have the new syllabus, and they were the first year to do it.”

But the direktors stressed that the play would still appeal to older Reedies who are unfamiliar with the new syllabus. “All of the old, major Hum Play things are still in there,” explained Dufresne.

While the direktors could not reveal anything about the characters, they did boast of the exceptionality of this year’s cast. “Our actors are awesome,” said Slaughter. Kafka added, “They are very good-looking.” The rest of the direktors agreed.

The direktors also stressed the importance of coming to see Hum Play, emphasizing Hum Play’s role as entertainment, tradition, and a learning experience. As Watson explained, “Hum Play is the morality play of Reed.”
