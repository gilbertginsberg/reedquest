At the beginning of this year, a group of freshman sat together on the grass in front of Commons trying to figure out what they could do to help alleviate the hunger crisis in Somalia. They became Reedies for Somalia.

Since then, a lot has happened. Reedies for Somalia has raised awareness of the situation through tabling at Commons and holding information sessions to inform those interested in learning more.

The year is coming to an end, though, and the culmination of all their efforts is happening tomorrow, Saturday, April 7th, in Kaul Auditorium with their fundraiser &#8220;Somali Relief: Let&#8217;s Take Action.&#8221;

The event will last from 5 until 8 PM, supplementing the Nitrogen Day festivities with performances of authentic Somali arts like Dhaanto, a Somali dance, and Buraanbur, Somali women&#8217;s poetry in addition to a performance by Reed freshman Paapa hMensa.

The real highlight of the event, however, are the two speakers who will be providing their insight into the situation. Anthropology Professor China Sherz will explain the situation in Somalia, and her input will be supplemented by Hamayoun Jamali, a famine relief worker who recently spent time in Somalia. Mostafa Abdul Kadir, who was raised in Somalia and has now become very active in the Somali community in Portland will also join these speakers to share his story with us.

There will be plenty going on at the event, aside from the aforementioned acts. There will be opportunities to buy Reedies for Somalia merchandise, the proceeds of which will all go to benefit Somalia, and to get Henna tattoos. There will also be a silent auction at the event in which people will have a chance to bid on artwork and jewelry made by local artists all in the name of relief.

All of the funds made at the event will be sent to Islamic Relief USA a charity that was chosen for its stability, transparency, and longstanding presence in Somalia. Their mission is to &#8220;alleviate suffering, hunger, illiteracy, and diseases worldwide regardless of color, race, religion, or creed, and to provide aid in a compassionate and dignified manner.&#8221;

Reedies for Somalia hopes that aside from helping achieve IRUSA&#8217;s noble mission the event may help kickstart the student body&#8217;s involvement in sociopolitical events around the world.
