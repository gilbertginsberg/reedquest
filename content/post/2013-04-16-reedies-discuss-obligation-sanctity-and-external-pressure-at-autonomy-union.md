Three months after President Kroger canceled or altered three Paideia classes, Reed community members filled out the pews in the Chapel on Friday for the Reed Union entitled “Student Autonomy: Its Possibilities and its Limits.” President Kroger attended but only spoke up twice: once to explain that he could stay for the entire Union because he had canceled his theatre date with his wife, and a second time to joke that he did not intend to argue that having sex on campus is an Honor Principle violation, as President Sullivan did in 1961.

English Professor Roger Porter introduced the Union’s five panelists and started the discussion by asking what student body autonomy is and how it should be defined.

John Sheehy ’83, trustee and author of _Comrades of the Quest: An Oral History of Reed College_, described the relationship between students and the administration as a “dance,” saying that there is “inherent tension between freedom and responsibility.” Sheehy said that spring crises like this semester’s Paideia controversy, which he jokingly referred to as “Paideiagate,” bring tension to the dance. According to Sheehy, “when the dance fails, it fails due to apathy on the part of one partner,” so it is necessary to continually question the relationship between the student body and the administration, and the way the community functions as a whole.

Judicial Board Chair Lilli Paratore ’13 made a distinction between individual student autonomy and student body autonomy. Student autonomy, she said, is “personal free choice,” and student body autonomy “has to do with governing and with self regulation.”

Paratore said that there are three states in which the student body can exist: the first being total freedom, the second with student-elected bodies of government, and the third in which these bodies are mere façades of representation. “The second is what I see as ideal,” Paratore said.

Psychology professor Kris Anderson explained that the ability to make independent decisions is a marker of the transition from adolescence to adulthood. The administration, she said, provides a necessary safety net during this period of students’ development.

</p>

Professor of Political Science and Humanities Peter Steinberger was the next panelist to speak. “I think the question of student autonomy is the wrong question,” he said. “The issue is not with student autonomy, but with student obligation.” According to Steinberger, faculty, staff, and students all share obligations to one another.

Steinberger said that contemporary conceptions of higher education as an industry frustrate him because they run counter to this notion of obligation. “The ideology of autonomy is highly relevant in the world of commerce,” he said. Such a relationship is based on an understanding that each party does what they want with their “stuff” as long as it does not harm the other party. “But a community devoted to exploration of ideas is a community of friendships,” Steinberger said, “with a joint pursuit shared among us.” Inherent in this participation, he explained, is a rejection of the conception of autonomy as freedom from obligation or limitation.

  Next to speak was Vice President and Dean of Student Services Mike Brody, who prefaced his talk by noting that people often tell him that he has the worst job in the world. Nevertheless, Brody said, “I feel like I have the best job in the world, because it’s hard. It’s an opportunity to work together.”

</p>

Brody said, “I am essentially the student autonomy antichrist,” referring to the impositions on student autonomy that Student Services inevitably makes, though he noted that he does not see himself that way. “I see this as a partnership,” Brody said.

While some might prefer to see the eradication of his involvement in student affairs, Brody said, “We exist in a financial, political, and legal reality where that is just not possible.”

Brody also recognized that while external legal realities create a context within which Reed exists, the community is able define itself within those limits. “We together have an opportunity to reinvent this place as we go. We shouldn’t be stripped of our autonomy as these things are happening outside.”

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Student Body President Ari Galper &#8217;14 said that student body autonomy can be a horrible burden, and that “limits to student body autonomy are ultimately a good thing.” He explained that in earlier years, students were more responsible for each other, and sometimes let their peers fall through the cracks. Still, Galper warned against passivity in accepting limits on autonomy.

</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Following the panelists, the audience had the opportunity to ask questions. Student Body Vice President Paul Messick ’15 began the question and answer section by asking, “What elements of student autonomy are sacred, and what needs to be cherished? What must not be tolerated, but cherished?”
</p>

Galper responded that the experience students gain from taking responsibility for themselves is sacred. While Anderson agreed that such opportunities are helpful in a student’s development, she qualified the sanctity of student responsibility by saying that it should be within a framework.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Steinberger replied that for him, two things are sacred: “A faculty that is committed to great undergraduate teaching, and a student body that is committed to the life of the mind.&#8221;
</p>

Paratore said that the issue is not what is sacred to one group or another; community agreements to uphold obligations to one another are sacred.

Nick Irvin ’13 steered the conversation towards the concrete when he asked, “How do people more directly involved conceive of mechanisms of institutional contraction and mechanisms of institutional expansion?” He wondered if, in terms of expansion, “we are going down the path that every other college has gone through, just at a slower pace.”

Brody replied that, while there is pressure from parents, the federal government, as well as the marketplace to do more, he does not anticipate an increase in student services staff in the foreseeable future. His reasoning: “Not because I don’t think we can make use of more staff, but because of the cold reality of the budget.” He concluded that they are resisting the trend in expansion, “because it is not sustainable.”

Though several community members still had questions, the Union concluded after two hours.
