Dear seething masses,

It’s hard to believe that we’re already on our fourth issue of the year. Before we go any further, we wanted to give the community a little update on the status of ReedQuest.org. Quest board member Andrew Choi and website ninja Lucy Butcher spent countless hours formatting the site over the summer to give our community a professional face to the outside world and Lucy has been diligently monitoring the site since we launched in August. Both of them have been doing a bomb-ass job, too.

And now for the serious stuff. Even before Senate sent out a poll to the student body regarding the Quest online, we had reached a compromise on which of our content would be public and which would be restricted to members of the community. As it stands, all hard news stories are fully accessible. Op-ed and “Fun Shit” writers are given the option to restrict access to their pieces. Only after they waive this right do we post their piece unmediated. Readers who wish to obtain access to restricted content can set up a membership by creating a user name and password with their Reed email. This allows only current students, faculty, staff, and alumni to view material that our staff and/or authors feel should remain within the community.

We recognize that putting the Quest online will greatly expand our readership, even in ways that we can’t predict. However, it will also allow us to provide the public with a plethora of firsthand information on the vibrant community that calls this campus home. For those who are concerned with the increased availability of potentially damaging information about the college, we ask: What could be worse than outside media coverage dominated by stories of rampant student drug use and financial trouble, and having no community-based counterpoint?

While in previous years the quality of the Quest has varied dramatically, we are committed to professionalizing the content of the paper through rigorous fact-checking, collaboration with other departments on campus, and codification of our copy editing procedure. In this sense, we are looking to establish the Quest as a legitimate community news source while staying true to the quirkiness that is so central to Reed. We anticipate that future boards will recognize the gravity of online distribution and build on this foundation of professionalism in their management of the paper.

For information about our procedure, see “[Things You Should Know About ReedQuest.org][1]” on the website. Read it, respond, tell us what you think. We’re your paper. Tell us how we can do what we love even better.

Pug love,
  
The Wild Wild Quest
