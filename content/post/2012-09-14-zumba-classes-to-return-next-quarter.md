Zumba, one of Reed’s most popular physical education classes of the last few years, was cancelled two weeks before the start of the fall semester. The class was cancelled after the former instructor resigned, and the Sports Center faced difficulties in process of hiring a new one, says  Michael Lombardo, director of athletics.

During the second half of the 2010-2011 academic year, Zumba was taught by Tracie Brothers. Following Brothers’ resignation, Traci Reeves was hired to teach Zumba during the fall and spring semesters of last year. Reeves was a visiting professor in the English department as well as a physical education instructor. After her contract with Reed expired, Reeves left Portland.

Brothers agreed on July 23 to return to Reed and teach Zumba on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 8-9 pm. Three weeks later, on August 12, Brothers sent an email to Lombardo that stated that she had accepted a new position in Houston and would not return to Reed. In the email, Brothers said that she was sad to leave Reed, but that the new position would allow her to be closer to family.

The process was further complicated by a mistake in an email sent to students that had registered for Zumba for the fall quarter. The email read that Traci Reeves accepted a job out of state, but it should have read that Tracie Brothers was relocating.

Lombardo says that he could not find an instructor &#8220;despite [his] best efforts&#8221;, and that he hates &#8220;canceling a popular class at all.&#8221; According to Lombardo, the Zumba classes are tentatively scheduled to resume on October 23rd.
