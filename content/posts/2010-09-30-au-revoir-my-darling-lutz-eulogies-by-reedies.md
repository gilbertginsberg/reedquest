The door. That door. You know the one. Years of forgetting have painted it red in my mind. Or black. But it was probably blue. And faded. As is my memory of it.

It had a sound. A sound that even years of forgetting have done nothing to diminish. A sound that was audible even when you were sitting at the chips and assorted candies side of the bar; even when a game of pool was well underway; even when the corner table was belligerently washing their third round of bones; even when our fearless, metal-loving, hat-clad leader was having his way with the juke. That sound carried with it so much promise. Anyone absent could become present at any moment. Anyone could walk through that door. Anyone with proper photo identification and a taste for cheap, high life. Cheap, high life.

Guarded by the neon blitz of its past and ours, that door separated the bad from the good, the unclean from the holy. We have seen it from both sides. We have peered through the windows that flank it. We have smoked just outside of it. It has been very kindly suggested to us that we should leave with haste.

But oh! Oh! The memory of things past and soon obsolete first filled me with great pause, and subsequently with great sorrow. But now. Now! Now it simply is not bearable. The thought of that door swinging shut, never again to open to let in weary pilgrims. Where will those pilgrims go? Or will the world birth pilgrims no more.

Memory, you cruel, cruel mistress. The hour of reckoning is nearing and I feel the urge to order one more round. Before the clock hands point up in complete surrender, up towards the heaven that will gladly receive you.

Oh Lutz, I once watched a man limp a great distance, on crutches, through the snowstorm of the century, to get to you. Would that I could walk through that door just one more time. Would that I could sit right there, just one more time. If you can see it in your mind too, if you can see that glorious vinyl place of rest, then you have been there too. You have known the journey.

I have no more to say if I cannot say it with your aid.

Never again will I eat a pickled egg in a paper boat.
