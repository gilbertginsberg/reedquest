Each year, graduating Reedies are offered the opportunity to apply for the Thomas J. Watson Fellowship. The Watson Fellowship is a one-year grant for independent study and travel outside the United States. Awarded to graduating college seniors at forty liberal arts colleges, applicants are nominated by their respective institutions and forty fellowships are granted each year.

Recipients are given $25,000 to spend pursuing an interest of their choice. This year, four nominees were selected: Jessica Gerhardt, Emmeline Friedman, Henry Hays-Wehle, and Kirsten Mandala were recognized by the Fellowship and Awards Committee as qualified candidates.

“The Watson Foundation requires no tangible output, emphasizing that the grant is an investment in a person rather than a project,” says Jo Cannon, Reed’s Fellowships Coordinator, “It’s an extraordinary opportunity.”

Extraordinary indeed. The Watson Fellowship allows students to immerse themselves in an experience that is entirely of their design, allowing them to create, execute, and evaluate their own projects.

From sailing tall ships (Caitlin Shrigley, ’05) to fishing (Lukas Strickland, ’08), applicants are selected based on their passion for a specific area of study.

“The Watson Fellowship is intended to be a time when fellows are their own advisors,” states the official website for the Thomas J. Watson Foundation. The purpose of the fellowship is “to enhance [the student’s] capacity for resourcefulness, imagination, openness, and leadership and to foster their humane and effective participation in the world community.”

Students who are eligible for the fellowship must meet a unique set of criteria.

Highly self-motivated individuals who express an interest in further exploring a field that they have some level of experience in are encouraged to apply.

“[Previous awardees] described the experience they had already acquired and convinced both the fellowships and awards committee and the Watson Foundation that their motivation was broad, deep, and genuine; and that their project was both challenging and feasible,” says Cannon.

And the absence of a defined end result allows students to take their interests in unexpected directions. Take, for example, Oberlin graduate Julie Taymor. Her passion for theatre and puppetry led to a Watson to study pre-Bunraku puppetry on the island of Awaji, Japan, in order to learn more about experimental theatre, puppetry, and visually oriented theatre. She went on to become the director and costume designer for the Broadway production of The Lion King, for which she received two Tony awards. “Now that’s passion,” says Cannon.

Awardees will be announced in March 2011. Students interested in applying in the future should visit the Watson website at [www.watsonfellowship.org][1], and also contact the Fellowships and Awards Committee for more advice and information about applying for a Watson Fellowship.

“Anyone in any class (except senior) who would like to be notified about information session should send his/her name to me,” says Cannon, “Hopefully, some underclassmen will be inspired to think about their own projects.”

**On-campus groups/activities:** I’m a mentor in the Peer Mentor Program, a member of Oh For Christ’s Sake and -ism: Reed’s group for Social Change, a coordinator of open mic nights, a House Advisor, an Admission Intern, and a tutor for Social Psych.

**Extracurricular hobbies/interests:** stargazing, playing ukulele, singing, songwriting, painting, drawing, doing comedy improv, blowing bubbles, speaking Spitalian (Spanish/Italian), tickling myself, going on the swings, making wishes on dandelions and eyelashes, and linking daisy chains.

What are you planning to use the Watson Fellowship for?** 
  
My project proposal entails going around the world stargazing and eclipse chasing.  I want to be able to see events that are only visible for a few minutes from specific parts of the world and I want to be able to see constellations that aren’t visible from the Northern Hemisphere.  I looked ahead at an astronomy calendar that lists various astronomical events that are happening in the coming years and tells where those events are visible from and then decided which countries I would want to go to.  I’ll be traveling from South Africa, where I’ll witness a partial solar eclipse, to Australia, where I’ll see a total lunar eclipse. From there, I’ll travel to Argentina spend time with a group called GAMA (the sister astronomy club of Portland’s Rose City Astronomers), and on from there to Guatemala, where I’ll learn about Mayan Astronomy. After that, I’ll go to Japan where I’ll see an annular solar eclipse, a partial lunar eclipse, and the transit of Venus across the sun.

I’m basically a huge astronomy nerd. I’m mesmerized by constellations, searching for satellites, and just by simple, everyday/night sky appreciating.  Stargazing has also been a huge source of inspiration for many paintings I’ve made and songs I’ve written. I love that all people from all parts of the world see many of the same constellations and all the same planets, despite how different our Earthly perspectives may be.  My project is designed to help me learn how living in different locations on Earth impacts the way diverse people interpret and understand the night sky.

**Major:** Anthropology

On-campus groups/activities:** I’m a Housing Adviser and Interconnect Mentor, and also involved in Real Food Challenge.

**Extracurricular hobbies/interests:** Organic farming, elder care, running, traveling, surfing, folk music, the ocean
  
**
  
What are you planning to use the Watson Fellowship for?**
  
I want to travel to rural farming communities to understand what it means to grow old and the kinds of care the elderly receive in different cultures. By participating in eldercare, I will learn about the changes in bodies, movements, stories told, ways of speaking, and relationships that accompany aging in each community. Through learning how to farm, I will be able to learn about elders’ relationships with the land and demonstrate the knowledge that I gain from the stories and wisdoms I receive through care giving. Rather than seeing the practice of care giving as a burden, I want to learn how to care for the elderly in a way that brings the caregiver and the recipient a joy for living.

**Any other information you think is relevant/interesting:**
  
I spent the past summer in Dehra Dun, India, making a film as an intern with Navdanya, a participatory research organization dedicated to supporting small-scale biodiverse farming, seed sharing, and traditional agricultural knowledge. The film will be screened at Reed this coming November.

**HENRY HAYS-WEHLE**

**Extracurricular hobbies/interests:** Hiking, snowboarding, cooking. And I heart my drum set.

What are you planning to use the Watson Fellowship for?**
  
I’d like to spend a year walking and helping build several long-distance hiking trails: the Great Baikal Trail in Russia, the Rim of Africa trail in South Africa, and el sendero de Chile.

I am, if nothing else, a connoisseur of maple syrup.

What are you planning to use the Watson Fellowship for?** 
  
My project is to study musical expressions of nonviolence in Islamic communities located in Senegal, Turkey, India, and Indonesia. Despite popular discourse that conflates Islam with violence and intolerance, there are movements that have begun as a means to participate in politics, improve community life, and promote peace itself. From hip-hop to the traditional Sufi dhikr, I intend to work with artists to understand how their creative vision relates to peace and the Islamic tradition.

**Any other information you think is relevant/interesting:** 
  
I haven’t spent a summer in the United States since I was 16. Most significantly, in 2009 I received the Davis Project for Peace with a partner to teach conflict resolution and peace building to youth in Kigali, Rwanda and assemble a children’s library. I spent last spring semester studying abroad at Al Akhawayn University in Morocco, and continued my stay through the summer to study intensive Arabic in Jordan.
