Unbeknownst to students, the alumni flooding campus last weekend were here not only to celebrate President Kroger’s inauguration, but to plot the future of the college as a whole.

The Reed Leadership Summit, previously known as Volunteer Weekend, met Friday and Saturday. President of the Alumni Board Chantal Sudbrack ‘97 says it was bigger than ever. “The number of volunteer activities for alumni has grown well beyond just the alumni board, reunions and chapter work to include the Reed Oral History project, Alumni Fundraising for Reed, and a number of other volunteer initiatives,” she says.

Many of the events in the Leadership Summit centered on students’ lives after Reed. A panel of Reed administrators, including President John Kroger, “wrestled with,” in its own words, “Reed’s Big Issues.” Though the panel discussed everything from admissions to student wellness, the employment rate of graduating classes was given special attention. Kroger says “thesis blinders” leave Reedies unprepared for finding a job and are the reason that recent graduating classes have had low employments rates compared to their counterparts from other liberal arts colleges. But this does not mean that Reed will have to fundamentally change its mission, says Dean of Students Mike Brody. “Education for education’s sake is not mutually exclusive with education for meaningful work,” he says. Kroger was quick to point that though Reed graduates are slower to find a job, six months after graduating they catch up with their peers. However, Kroger would like more alumni to help recent graduates along the way. He says, “We need more alumni coming to campus…You are the role models…it opens up [Reedies’] perspective for what is possible.”

But the Life Beyond Reed committee, which also met as part of the Summit, is working on a solution. Sudbrack ’97 says, “The…vision for Life Beyond Reed includes the career development of current students, recent graduates and mid-career graduates through mentoring and experiential learning opportunities, like shadowing and internships.” The committee is hosting its second Working Weekend and Reed Startup Lab February 1 &#8211; 3, 2013 where alumni will host workshops and panels in a range of fields including business, medicine, and education. Sudbrak ’97, says, “We believe that Life Beyond Reed will cultivate happier, more prosperous alumni who feel a closer connection to the college (hopefully happier and more prosperous students too!).”
