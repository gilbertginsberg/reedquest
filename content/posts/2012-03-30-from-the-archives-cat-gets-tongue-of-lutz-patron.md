An altercation between a Lutz Tavern bartender and a customer resulted in severed body parts and allegations of negligence against a Reed student.

A little past 10 PM on the night of October 27, Lutz patron Willie Gallegly reportedly became upset when bartender Paul Lupino refused to serve him more alcohol. The ensuing argument escalated into an eye-to-eye shouting match. Lupino then bit off the tip of Gallegly’s tongue, and spit it back out “in his general direction.”

Witness reports say that the argument took place at such close range that Gallegly’s tongue was already virtually in the mouth of Lupino.

A subsequent search of the tavern floor failed to turn up the severed piece of tongue, and the victim proceeded to the hospital without it, where he received five stitches, according to Lupino. Gallegly later told _The Oregonian_ that he received between twelve and seventeen stitches.

Reed student Peter Forsyth came to drink at the bar later that night, along with his kitten Christopher. The kitten is reportedly popular with the bar staff, and is therefore tolerated in exception to the Lutz’s no-pet policy. When Christopher took a particular interest in something on the floor, however, Lutz staff accused Forsyth of having allowed his cat to eat the missing piece of tongue. Forsyth maintains that this allegation is entirely spurious.

No charges are expected to be pressed in the incident, says Lupino, since Gallegly’s unruly behavior in the bar amounted to the commission of “two crimes” in itself.

Police reports have been filed, and the Oregon Liquor Control Commission is conducting a followup investigation.

In the meanwhile, Lupino has become something of a celebrity. _The Oregonian_ report of the incident received national attention, and nationwide public radio personality Paul Harvey called Lupino for an interview. Lupino gave no comment either to Harvey or _The Oregonian_.
