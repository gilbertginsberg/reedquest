Honey, you have got to STOP!!! My eyes cannot take it. Your walk is a problem of epic proportions, in terms of an old joke: “I haven’t seen a walk like THAT since dinosaurs walked the earth!”

Sometimes the image of caveman is what I see when I look at certain people walk.

After millions of years of evolution and still walking like a Neanderthal. No, actions have to be taken.  A person’s walk speaks volumes about who you are, it is part of the first impression. The way a person carries their body tells us major clues about their personality and temperament. So, walking like you have a watermelon between your legs is not a good way to tell us about yourself.

A few basic tips:

  * Back straight. The Hunchback of Notre Dome look went out with Quasimodo, and it’s not making a comeback. So straighten up and arch.
  * Shoulders pulled back, and fly off that floor.
  * Chin up, so you can actually see where you’re going.
  * For those of you without much ass Push It Out.

As for the actual walk try putting one foot in front of the other, taking some of the effort from the hips. Work the calves and the thighs; do not drag your damn feet. Walk like you have a purpose, walk like you are on a runway. If visual aid is needed try watching Rupaul’s Drag U or reruns of Drag Race, and let drag queens show you how it’s done. Not until you can walk in at least 3-inch heels can you say you can walk.

Men, this goes for you as well, even more so.

And keep in mind “heel then toe.” I repeat, “heel THEN toe.” Try not to fall on your ass. Just plopping the foot down on the ground is not an attractive look, nor does it make a very pleasing sound. The sound of your tired ass hitting pavement reminds me of the graceful stomping of a water buffalo. You’re suppose to flutter, not seem like your trying to strike oil.

So Bitch Work It!!!
