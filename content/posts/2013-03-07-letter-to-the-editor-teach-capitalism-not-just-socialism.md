excerpt: "My wife and I walked through your beautiful campus recently. During our stroll I perused the various placards on the student union building. One of the posters depicted in a lionizing way Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin, all socialists and/or communists. This caused me to think. I understand higher education ought teach all views, I understand students are idealistic and enthusiastic and I understand that much of academia's bent today is liberal and collectivistic. What I wondered was whether Reed College's professors were offering alternative views for students to ponder."

Dear Editor:

My wife and I walked through your beautiful campus recently. During our stroll I perused the various placards on the student union building. One of the posters depicted in a lionizing way Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin, all socialists and/or communists. This caused me to think. I understand higher education ought teach all views, I understand students are idealistic and enthusiastic and I understand that much of academia&#8217;s bent today is liberal and collectivistic. What I wondered was whether Reed College&#8217;s professors were offering alternative views for students to ponder.

I am curious to know how many Reed College students have read Adam Smith&#8217;s _The Wealth of Nations_, Thomas Malthus _An Essay on Population_, Ayn Rand&#8217;s _Atlas Shrugged_, Paul Johnson&#8217;s characterization of Marx in _The Intellectuals_, any honest biography of Stalin or any of Milton Freidman&#8217;s books on economics? Capitalism and socialism are philosophic theories competing in America today. They both offer something useful, but in my view capitalism trumps socialism.

I am curious to know if Reed College students are being exposed to both economic/political philosophies or does the poster represent the Reed College communities&#8217; zeitgeist. In my view, if one view is being taught it is propaganda and not education.

We live in a complicated world where there are no easy solutions. We need smart, liberally educated and _broad-minded_ young people like those at Reed to solve them.
