A brave king will battle arrogant demons in a duel of dance, lovely young hermit-girls will frolic in a peaceful grove, and a spurned lover will be swallowed by the earth to hide her humiliation. When _Shakuntala: An Indian Fairytale_, the directing thesis production of theatre major Indu Manohar ’12, opens this weekend, be prepared for a story that seems at once familiar and unknown. Though the places and the characters are from ancient India, the play follows an all-too-recognizable pattern: the king Dushyanta falls in love with the hermit-girl Shakuntala at first sight, an error by the lovestruck heroine spells disaster, and after a period of suffering, she enjoys a happy ending. The plot’s simplicity allows Manohar and her team to concentrate telling the story in a variety of ways.

Manohar has fond memories of the tale of Shakuntala, as it was the plot of the first classical Indian _bharata natyam_ dance performance she saw as a child. As an intimately familiar story, it was a suitable choice for her project of exploring storytelling. As a folklore classic in India, it has been used in traditional performing arts, as well as newer media like soap operas and graphic novels. She also found inspiration in the theory of Bertolt Brecht, an influential German theatre practitioner of the twentieth century.

Each of the actors portrays multiple characters, often switching between them in the same scene. Costume designer Heather Chan ’13 says she deliberately “played down gender characteristics” when creating the neutral outfits for the cast. They all carry _dupattas_, a garment that is essentially a long strip of fabric that is worn differently each time an actor plays a new character.

The actors do not just play their own roles. In some sections, they narrate their own thoughts and actions in the third person; in others, they break from the scene to excitedly gather around a single character to hear the narration of events from the past. In some scenes, pairs of actors portray different aspects of the same character: voice and body, inner thoughts and outward expression, or even two physical halves of the same person.

The contrast with traditional theatre is strongest in the use of dance as a means for telling the story. The prominence of dance in the production stems from Manohar’s belief that the distinction between dance and drama in Indian performance is a “false dichotomy.” She cites the Sanskrit word _natya,_ which is __variously translated as either dance or drama, but probably best understood as dance-drama. The choreography in the play uses techniques from _kathak_, an Indian dance form, in which Manohar has trained for years. Unlike other forms of Indian dance, _kathak_ derives much of its poses from natural movements, so the meanings of the different representational poses and gestures are clear even to those unfamiliar with the form.

Zach Horváth ’13 created the lighting design with this emphasis on dance in mind. Like Manohar, Horváth says he thought about “how dance productions I had seen in my childhood looked like.” The resulting design features a broad range, from a lone elegant spot on the idol of the god Shiva to the rapidly flashing colors of the battle scene that betray Horváth’s self-proclaimed “enthusiasm for concert lighting.” Commenting on the significance of the lighting design in the production, Manohar jokes, “Lighting is the most importance character in this piece.”

As can be expected of such an old story, Manohar confesses that on her first reading of the script, she found “a lot of cringeworthy moments…a lot of misogyny.” She had considered “drawing attention to those moments in a Brechtian way,” but later chose not to focus on the antiquated social and gender dynamics. Beth Dinkova ’13, assistant director, agrees that they were best left in the play as an acknowledgement of the past. The social injustices in the story are not “culturally and chronologically bound; they are part of our shared past,” says Dinkova. She adds that issues of “being confined or being subjects of someone’s authority even appear today.”

Though the production does not adopt Brecht’s vision of creating social change, it does employ many of his meta-theatrical techniques to prevent the audience from becoming emotionally invested in the story. As they walk in, the audience will be confronted with the stark set design of Autumn Dobbins ’13: a bare black stage with a thick white line delineating the ‘sacred’ performance space. The light trees on either side are not hidden with curtains, and the running crew, as well as any “off-stage” actors, sit in plain sight of the audience.

The sound design posed particular problems as “there was no way to create a distancing effect using music,” said Shruti Korada ’14, sound designer. Korada has a background in Carnatic music, a classical tradition from the south of India. She chose audio tracks that would complement the mood of each scene, using flute music for love scenes or the tabla, a pair of hand-drums, to create tension. While the sound design does indulge the sentiments of the audience, Korada hopes that the absence of music as it fades out will create the desired effect of emotional alienation.
