This September marked the beginning of Strategic Planning, a year and a half-long process of assessing Reed and determining what the future should look like. Eleven working groups were formed from student, faculty, and staff volunteers, which will discuss various aspects of the college.

In January, the working groups will create a mini report that will be presented to President Kroger as a checkpoint in the process. Another report will be produced in April, and by next fall the decisions of the working groups will be implemented.

During a senate meeting in April of last semester, Kroger said, “Strategic Planning is not about change for change’s sake, but about our values&#8230; What do we love about Reed and what needs to be preserved, and what needs to be changed if we could?”

Most of the groups have met once or twice so far and have begun discussing preliminary questions within their topics.

Professor Ann Delehanty, chair of the “Whom do We Want to Educate” committee, explained that the group is working to articulate what it is that is exceptional about Reed students. Once they have come to an idea, the next question is: “how do we find those quirky, self-starters in all stratas of society and from all races?”

Delehanty noted that she welcomes anyone with thoughts on the topic to email her.

The committee on “Community Governance and Academic Administrative Structure” is starting off by reading through the Faculty, Student, and Community Constitutions, as well as the Reed Bylaws and the Articles of Incorporation.

According to group member and Director of Community Safety Gary Granger, with this knowledge of the documents, the group will be better equipped to decide whether or not the governing system is working.

“It’s a simple question, but hard to answer,” Granger says. “What do we mean by working?”

To help answer this question, the group is revisiting recent cases of governance at Reed, and assessing whether or not they went well. Granger cites the passing of the Discriminatory Harassment and Sexual Misconduct Policy as a recent example of governance. Although a new policy was passed, Granger says that the question is whether or not Reed’s current system allowed it to be passed fast enough.

While some of the working groups are more straightforward in the questions they seek to answer, Granger says this group is more nebulous: “This one’s a little harder to get our hands on in some ways, but that makes it more fun.”

According to senior John Iselin, who is a member of the committee on “Long-Term Financial Health of the Institution,” the group will take the ideas of the other groups and consider external factors to see how they might be implemented.

When asked about his hopes for Strategic Planning, Nigel Nicholson, Dean of Faculty and Professor of Classics said, “I hope that it goes smoothly, that we get good reports, and that we can reach a consensus.” He also noted that, “we’ve never done it quite like this.” Nigel explained that in previous years, Reed used to be much smaller, which made the entire process more manageable and inclusive. Now that the college has grown, consensus will be more difficult to reach and will require more people and more work to get to the bottom of what the community wants Reed to be.

Emphasizing that the whole goal and hope of Strategic Planning is to improve the quality of our education at Reed, Nigel said that students should be aware of the student representatives on the working groups, and when the open forums will occur. “People have to understand it’s a community based process.”

According to Nigel, Strategic Planning at other intuitions tends to be much narrower, but “ours is more open than many. We’d like to err on the side of letting people contribute freely.”
