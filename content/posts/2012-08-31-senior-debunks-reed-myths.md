Dear New Reedies,

You’re probably overwhelmed with advice at this point. That said, I’d like to take a shot at the semi-annual “an upperclassman attempts to impart wisdom” article and address a few things about Reed that – in this humble senior’s opinion – are either questionable, counterproductive, or patently false. I hope to help you all avoid the missteps that I and other weary-eyed upperclassmen have made along the way, so that when you put on your laurels in 4 to __ years, you will have made Reed a better place and molded yourself into a more thoughtful and honorable person in the process.

**Sleep is for the weak. **

I say this as someone whose coffee addiction has etched dark circles beneath his eyes: at a certain point, just go to sleep. Since grades aren’t very important here, determining when you’re “done” with homework is much more ambiguous. This may be less of an issue during the fall semester, but once the work starts to pile up, insist upon making time to take care of yourself. I’ve heard tales that more sleep even makes you more alert during the day, which actually helps you study better! I know, it doesn’t make any sense to me, either.

**Reed is the greatest most bestest college (Quallege?) in the whole wide world! Also, all other schools suck.**

There are two parts to this myth: First is the happy, shiny, College Honeymoon phase. It’s awesome and feels great, but will be gone by around November once the rain settles in. But the Honeymoon Phase can apply to so many other things that I don’t think focusing on it will yield any original conclusions. All I can say is that you’ll come back down to earth–which is normal–and that Reed is not exempt from having its own problems–which is also normal. The latter observation will probably be the subject of many _Quest_ articles to come.

The second part is this little thing called Reed Exceptionalism (henceforth referred to as R.E). I may have exaggerated with my subtitle, but make no mistake: R.E. is not uncommon. And there is a very fine line between being proud and excited to be a part of this community and feeling superior to those who attend other schools. (Especially state schools, we really like to talk about how much better we are than state schools).

Shed that perception while you still can. Based on firsthand experience, I can also tell you that R.E. makes you an insufferable person to be around when you go home.

**You’re not a real Reedie until you’ve had your first Renn Fayre.**

This one’s a staple among upperclassmen (including myself). “Renn Fayre” can be substituted for any number of things–“all-nighter in the library,” “smoked pot in the canyon,” “made out with fifty people at Thesis Parade,” etc.–but the underlying premise behind each statement is essentially the same: You’re not one of us until you’ve done x or y.

It’s true that there are many things about Reed culture that need to be experienced in order to be fully understood. It’s also true that you all have a lot to learn, and that upperclassmen know more about student culture by virtue of having spent more time here. But this reality sometimes mutates into an ugly and insidious form of exclusion.

In actuality, the question “Am I a Reedie?” was answered when you got your envelope of confetti. The only question you need to worry about is how you’ll spend your time here. Much of that time will be spent studying, but much of it is also completely within your control. Do things you enjoy, don’t do things that don’t appeal to you, and leave it at that.

**You shouldn’t make noise in the library.**

Just kidding. This one’s completely true. Do not talk in the library. You can show your friend that adorable kitten video in the lobby. And eat your crispy potato chips there, too.
