With support from senate, faculty, and administration, Honor Council has begun preparing for the first Reed Union since the 2007. The upcoming Reed Union, which is tentatively scheduled for late March or April, will be the third to focus on the vitality and viability of the Honor Principle. Honor Council hopes that the community-wide forum will encourage the entire campus to consider how the Honor Principle affects student life, and whether it, alongside the mediation group, should be altered to more properly suit the needs of the community.

The first Reed Union took place in 1947. According to the college website, a Reed Union is a “moderated discussion featuring panels of experts in dialogue with members of the audience.”

According to Sen. Jenny Calvert-Warren, liaison to the Honor Council, this “panel of experts” can consist of members from outside the community so as to gain external perspective on the issue at hand. Honor Council hopes that they can recruit an alum – possibly one from the current board of trustees – to sit on the panel. Honor Council has not chosen any specific individuals to sit on the panel or an individual to moderate the forum yet. Sen. Calvert-Warren also indicated that Honor Council has been in discussion with former-dean of the faculty Peter Steinberger about reassuming his role as moderator. Steinberger moderated the most recent Reed Union in 2007.

In preparation for the Union, Honor Council has recently taken steps to involve the community in a dialogue about the Honor Principle. Honor Council member Lizzie Sandercock noted that “editorials” (requests for written responses) have been sent out to select students with “specific and interesting perspectives” on what the Honor Principle can or should mean to the Reed community.

“[The Honor Principle] works very differently for different people in different positions,” Sandercock said in regard to the editorials’ distribution. Sandercock is optimistic that this group of currently unnamed students will reveal differentiating, and even disparate, opinion about the Honor Principle.

Honor Council has also sent out a survey to the entire student body. According to Honor Council, this survey is meant to gauge what aspects of Reed life are most important to the Honor Principle. Topics on the survey range from noise complaints to drug use to discrimination.

Sandercock admitted that while the Honor Principle is by no means is dead, its role in the Reed community has been steadily losing its centralized and focused position.

“The Honor Principle involves a lot of personal responsibility and reflection that has been lacking lately,” Sandercock said. “There’s a lot more policy being enacted at Reed that probably in previous times would’ve been deemed unnecessary because the Honor Principle accounts for so much. That’s not to say that I’m against the AOD plan or what the administration is doing right now, but I would like to see people reconsidering how the Honor Principle should effect their own actions.”

For Sandercock, the ultimate purpose behind the Reed Union is to have students reevaluate whether they would still like a community based upon these principles, or if the college’s policies should be taken in another direction.

“A lot of what we’ve been doing this year is reconsidering what our role is and whether that should change, or whether we need to go back to something that used to be done [in terms of policy],” Sandercock said. She noted that students never come to Honor Council’s regular office hours, do not usually sit in on Honor Council meetings, and frequently tell her that they are uncertain of the group’s purpose. Because of these changing tides, Sandercock notes, Honor Council has been discussing significantly changing its purpose at Reed.

Honor Council hopes that the upcoming Reed Union, as well as everything leading up to and following the event, will help answer that question. When asked what she hoped would come out a Reed Union, Sandercock showed a sincerity and frankness about Reed’s current student body; one she hopes the entire community will exhibit when Honor Council is given a place at the center of Reed life.

“I’d like to see people excited about the Honor Principle, reconsidering what it means, and how it can helpfully be a part of our community. I think that it really is necessary for the community to function well, but we’re not seeing it do that at the moment.”
