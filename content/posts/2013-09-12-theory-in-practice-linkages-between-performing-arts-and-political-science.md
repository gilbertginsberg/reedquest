Reed’s new preforming arts building may have unforeseen benefits, especially for the Political Science Department. Thursday night, guest speaker Dr. Emily Beausoleil presented her work on the contingency of political receptivity on somatic cues that may actually be harnessed, the same cues that dancers, performers, and movement therapists depend on.

The night began with a nod to Humanities 110. Political Science professor Tamara Metz reminded the room of how the Athenians’ realized an intrinsic connection between theater and democracy, but as neuroscientific research and theory advances, Beausoleil offers a novel linkage between those points and a new affirmation of the liberal arts tradition.

To utilize those linkages, Beausoleil proposes a physical and mental kind of embodied listening, similar to that practiced by performers, like spatial awareness, perceptiveness to external stimuli, and a focus on regular breathing. From these methods of embodied listening, Dr. Beausoleil is working on developing what would become, literally, theory in practice.

Beausoleil’s lecture, “Moved to Listen: The Embodied Conditions of Receptivity in Politics,” explained that political receptivity, the openness to consider alternatives and release personal assumptions, is heavily tied to embodied listening. Embodied listening can be described as the sensory and physical work that allows one to immerse oneself in another’s perspective.

For the experts on embodied listening—dancers, movement therapists, and performers— listening is primarily corporeal, Beausoleil says. The attention and responsiveness that they devote to the physical and emotional dynamics of a situation enable them more empathy for others.

An example includes salsa dancing: partners often begin by practicing with their eyes closed, alert to sensations less limiting than sight, to develop better knowledge of their partners. Beausoleil even quotes a salsa dancer describing the embodied listening innate to dance as “moving slowly and reading the response; that’s almost the only tool we have.” Likewise, dancers have frequently described “a loss of sense of one’s self in the act of creation,” a space that allows for receptivity and the ability to challenge deeply held assumptions.

Theater and dance have long demonstrated the ability to reframe one’s selfhood, and mitigate the intrinsic close-mindedness of self-other distinctions, according to Beausoleil.  In fact, most dance injuries, she notes, are caused when dancers become too conscious of themselves as individuals or disengaged from the collective goal, for example, setting weight off balance. The distinction between the self and other has been reciprocally injurious in the field of political science.

Beausoleil evokes political theorists like Judith Butler and James Tully who have isolated the self and other dichotomy as the origin of epistemic violence. Although theorists or people engaged in conflict resolution are not often physical performers, Beausoleil is working on translating performers’ use of embodied listening into a workable practice for theorists. Senior Ariel Dooner noted after the lecture that “simply reframing selfhood as situatedness or expanding the notion of reasonableness to include affect and somatic response opens really amazing doors.”
