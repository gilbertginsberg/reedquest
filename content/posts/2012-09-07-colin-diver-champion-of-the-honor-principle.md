Former president of Reed College Colin Diver championed the Honor Principle in [a letter to _The Boston Globe_ on Wednesday][1] in response to a recent [cheating scandal][2] at Harvard University.

“Recent allegations of widespread cheating in a course at Harvard have provoked much hand-wringing among Harvard professors and administrators,” Diver says. “Their diagnoses and prescriptions predictably fall into two groups, depending on whether one is optimistic or pessimistic about the ethical capacity of today’s college students.”

Harvard reported last Thursday that approximately 125 undergraduate students are believed to have collaborated on a take-home final exam this past spring. If allegations prove true, students who cheated could be suspended for up to a year.

Honor Council member Ian Walling ’14 says the scandal is relevant even at honorable Reed. “I think in reference to this scandal it is worth remembering our Honor Principle originated from a commitment not to cheat on exams.” He adds, “We do know that Reedies cheat on tests, there is an Academic Misconduct Board.”

Diver agrees. “None of the steps Reed College has taken can eliminate academic dishonesty entirely,” he says. “Cheating occurs at Reed and is severely punished. But reports of cheating are remarkably rare.”

But in an era when academic dishonesty is easier than ever, Diver remains hopeful. “I am an optimist about promoting academic honesty among today’s generation of college students. I’ve seen it happen. But I’ve also seen the kind of institutional commitment that it takes to make it happen.”
