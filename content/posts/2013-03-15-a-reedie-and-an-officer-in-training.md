[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2174" alt="Carlo D'Amato" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.reedquest.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1556_web.jpg?resize=770%2C513" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]Six days a week, Carlo D’Amato ’16 attends Hum and lives at Reed like any other freshman. But every Tuesday, he spends eight hours at the University of Portland for Air Force Reserve Officer Corps Training. His weekly training involves a combination of drills, physical fitness training, and leadership activities.

Reed graduates and Air Force Academy graduates are respectively the most liberal and most conservative alumni groups in the nation, according to an October 2012 survey by The Alumni Factor, a website that ranks colleges according to alumni performance. Despite this cultural and political chasm, D’Amato says that his experiences at Reed and at ROTC in Portland have been more similar than one might think. “I think the differences are very superficial. Both places put academic excellence first. Both places emphasize honor; there, they just call it ‘integrity.’ I’ve found it pretty easy to go back and forth between the two places.”

D’Amato is uncertain whether he is the first Reedie to participate in ROTC, but Reed student participation is rare nonetheless. “The Registrar told me that I was the first ever…someone in my wing told me that while they’ve had Reedies before, they all eventually dropped out of the program,” D’Amato says.

Though D’Amato’s parents initially worried that his peers at Reed would respond negatively to his involvement with ROTC, he says that hasn’t been the case. “I think the worst thing I got was that someone said they weren’t down with the drone program,” said D’Amato.

D’Amato spent most of his childhood living in Italy and Russia, and often heard his peers making negative comments about the United States. The ROTC had always been on his radar, and his experiences abroad compelled him to join as a way to “give back to America.

During his senior year of high school, he applied for and received a scholarship through ROTC. The funding is awarded according to the Air Force&#8217;s needs, but is not contingent on the awardee&#8217;s choice of school or major. D’Amato currently plans to combine his ROTC experience with his study of Russian at Reed to find a job in his areas of interest.

So far, D’Amato has not encountered any scheduling conflicts. He spoke with both his department and his officers to ensure that he will not have to choose between attending ROTC training and going to class. “Academics come first, so if I have a class… at the same time, they’ll make it work. But you can’t just coast through.”

After D’Amato finishes at Reed, he will be commissioned as a Second Lieutenant. Air Force ROTC graduates also make an additional commitment to the military, with the number of years depending on their career path. Most cadets take on a four-year active duty commitment, but Combat Systems Officers and officers seeking careers in Air Battle Management incur a six-year commitment. Pilots sign on for ten.

Reedies like D’Amato will likely continue to be a rarity. But while D’Amato remains an anomaly, he is not alone in the Reed community: “I’m not the only one. The Grange has been in the Air Force, and so has his assistant.”
