**9:04pm:** Well, we don&#8217;t have a lot of content for this week (read: any), so um, four page paper? I mean, our best article is on snacks&#8230; Yeah, looks like issue 11 will be a four page paper. Also, [this][1].

**9:07pm:** Wait, back to an eight page paper now? Depends who voted for the Wu-Tang Clan? Really confused here. Stay tuned for more.

**9:14pm:** Nope. Four page paper. On another note, Ethan just pitched an interesting idea for our last issue. I don&#8217;t know how much I should say, but it involves our heads, Adobe Photoshop, and the gals from _Sex and the City_. Go figure.

**9:27pm:** Not too much going on, actually. You&#8217;d think that we&#8217;re pretty frantic, but now that we&#8217;re making a four page issue, everything seems to have chilled. We&#8217;re trying to find out what is up with election results. Apparently, people have received emails saying that they voted for the Wu. Hmm. Waiting for results from Batman & Robin.

**9:49pm:** Everything is copyedited (thanks Michela!), so we&#8217;re moving full-on to design. We may be short on content, but we&#8217;re going to make four fucking stellar pages. Believe it. 

**9:54pm:** Rebecca brought us cake. And we lost.

**11:13pm:** Sorry for the lack of updates, we&#8217;ve been kind of caught up eating cake, among other forms of coping. Also, still working on this issue. 4 is done, looking to fill a little empty space on it with a jump. We&#8217;ve started work on 1, following Chris Lydgate&#8217;s advice and livening up the masthead. Hi, Todd and Luca!

**11:24pm:** Have you heard the news? They&#8217;re removing caffeine from Four Loko. Seeing if we can make a story out of it.

**11:36pm:** Well, Four Loko is officially our masthead for this week. How is that for a eulogy?
