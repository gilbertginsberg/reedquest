Thursday evening before Spring Break, Nikky Finney visited the Chapel to read her poetry for the Visiting Writer Series. Finney, the Provost’s Distinguished Service Professor of English at the University of Kentucky, has written four books of poetry and a short story cycle. Her most recent book, _Head Off & Split_, published in 2011, earned her the National Book Award for Poetry. She received great acclaim for her acceptance speech, which was described by host John Lithgow as “a gorgeously stated discussion of race, reading, and writing,” and “the most beautiful acceptance speech for anything that I’ve ever heard in my life” in the Chicago Tribune.

At Reed, Finney was introduced by Crystal Ann Williams, Dean for Institutional Diversity, former Creative Writing professor and Finney&#8217;s longtime friend. Williams spoke of her admiration for Finney, noting her generosity and the “depth of feeling and of thought” present in her work. She opened by explaining how her poetic career began as a child keeping a journal in which she often asked herself: “When I leave my home, where is the generosity?” Finney describes poetry as her way of “seek[ing] the answer.”

Finney&#8217;s poems touched upon a number of themes, dwelling particularly on family. Lovingly, she shared, “I write a lot about my family. I keep thinking I’ll run out of characters, but I don’t,” said Finney. She opened with “Cat Tails,” a poem about friendship, which focuses on love, birth, and beauty by narrating an act of unexpected friendship overcoming miles. She then moved on to “Uncle Freddy Davenport,” an ode to her dreamer uncle that depicted a man who believes in his personal tradition against all outside doubt. Interspersed with untitled poems, she also read “Sign Language,” which speaks out against intolerance, and “The New Medicine,” a poem about going home “just to touch” her family that meditates on the importance and beauty of family.

> Finney&#8217;s poem “Left” painted the stark disparity between victim desperation and government apathy occurring in the Hurricane Katrina&#8217;s aftermath.

Finney&#8217;s poetry reading aimed to bridge gaps of difference between humans. She shared with the audience her hope that they be inspired by her poetry to act next time somebody reaches out to them for help. On this note, she concluded with “Left,” a diatribe against the lack of a national response to Hurricane Katrina, which deals with race and politics. This poem painted the stark disparity between victim desperation and government apathy occurring in the hurricane&#8217;s aftermath. Her poems reminded listeners to respond to human cries for help. The audience, which consisted largely of middle-aged Portlanders, was enthusiastic and often visibly moved. “Left” had some audience members in tears.

Finney stayed afterward to answer questions and speak with the audience. Asked about the decidedly narrative nature of her work, she said “I’m not an abstract person, I’m not an abstract writer; I like the fullness of a story.” She also discussed her writing process, noting that she can find a poem anywhere, and discussed her acceptance speech for the National Book Award, calling it an attempt to transcend the traditional acceptance speech and say thank you “without saying thank you.” She left the stage to a long round of applause.
