Have you ever craved a tasty Commons dinner but lacked the will-power leave the comfort of your dorm room? As of Monday, February 4, DeliveReed is helping to solve this problem for Reedies all over campus.

Now, Commons and Bookstore treats are just a few keystrokes away: fill out an online order form with your desired purchase, phone number, location, and email, and DeliveReed will first collect your payment and return promptly with your order.

The service is run by a small group of students who prefer to remain unnamed. “It isn&#8217;t a secret,” say the DeliveReedies when asked about their anonymity, “but we want to keep as much of the focus on the service itself as possible.” The service was first announced on Facebook and Tumblr in December. This past week, DeliveReed has been posting the Commons dinner menu and prices online along with the prices for the delivery services. As of Tuesday, the prices are $2 for delivery to ODB/FSM/Anna Mann, $3 for Cross Canyon Housing, Bragdon, Library, ETC, and $ 4 for Sullivan, Naito, The Grove, Language Houses, Apartments, Farm House,
  
Garden House, and Canyon House.

When asked about possible conflicts with Bon Appetit and the Bookstore, the DeliveReedies say, “We would hope that students and administration, as well as Bon Appetit and the Bookstore, recognize the benefits that this service provides for all. Bon Appetit is still receiving payment from a possibly wider student base and students receive their food from a safe and reliable source.” So far, they’ve received only positive feedback. “[The Bookstore]  love[s] the idea of a delivery service,” say the DeliveReedies. “They helped us set up a DeliveReed account to facilitate transactions and they have a portable ID card reader that they are trying figure out so that our customers will soon be able to pay with their bookstore account at their door.”

It’s been a busy week  for these DeliveReedies. “Our first night was amazing!” they say. “It was busier than we expected but we handled it well.” After a successful launch, this group of students is considering the possibility of expansion. Their next conquest? “The world over.”
