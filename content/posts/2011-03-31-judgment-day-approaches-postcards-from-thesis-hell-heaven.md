**Postcard from Thesis Hell**

Having been the poster child for overcoming stress culture at Reed for the past two and a half years, I assumed I’d be the last person to write this thing. And if I did, I thought it would be some moralizing, holier-than-thou, this-isn’t-hell-it’s-all-in-your-head type of thing. But after spring break—which should have been filled with sun, salaciousness, and ‘show us your titties,’ but was instead dominated by romantic vicissitudes, an academic juggling act, and the sixth plague of the semester—I’ll admit it: it’s not the stress culture, it’s just that time of year.

That’s right, I said it: life sucks a little, go ahead and suck right back. We all have drafts to finish, classes to pass, futures to plan, and shreds of social lives to maintain. Meanwhile, it’s springtime, and life is blossoming. Children and puppies are romping in the streets, and the sun is peeking out coyly behind the clouds. It’s also our last semester of college; we’re supposed to kick back and make this the best time of our lives while we still have the chance (not to mention drink during the day because, hey, it’s sunny out).

I don’t know about you, but I’m beginning to identify with Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman’s version). It’s Neverland, I’m a grownup surrounded by rambunctious kids having imaginary food fights, and all I can hear is the ticking of every clock around me. It’s making me a grumpy old wretch, and my moustache is twitching.

Underclassmen, please be kind. Whatever your gripe is—your friend is testy and cold because she changed her paper topic late in the game, or your testes are cold because that senior girl you’ve been hooking up with hasn’t left the library in a week—for the love of God, please wait to make drama about it for another week. This is the week to let us be the selfish, immature, irrational wrecks we’re supposed to be at the cranially-underdeveloped age of twenty-one-ish.

Seniors, you know you can do it (because you have to), so I’m not going to hand out advice on how to “make it through.” I’m just going to grant you, with a completely invented authority, permission to bitch. Take a swig of evil, shine that hook, and go smash some clocks. Maybe time won’t stand still, but at least you’ll get to dress like a pirate.

Rick Ross is bumping in my ears, to the steady beat of keystrokes.

_Every day I’m hustlin’ / Every day I’m hustlin’&#8230; hustlin’&#8230; hustlin’_

I’m mad at myself for writing nothing yesterday. I’m mad at myself for stalling for weeks, mad at myself for being behind schedule. _Let all that go, bring your attention where it needs to be: words and ideas right here right now._ It’s gorgeous when that happens. Only 20 more minutes, and then I can rest, basking in glorious satisfaction of a new page produced. Take a walk, and do it again.

Some classic 50 Cent comes up next:

_I’ve gotta make it to heaven / I’m going through hell_

I’ve been to hell and back for my thesis. I put myself under Lucifer’s whip, hoping to pay penance for my academic sins. But he’s a bad coach. Hell never gave me pages. So I dropped that scene like a bad habit.

Reed College beating you down? Recognize your right to push back.

_Predicated on the pressure to accept / And the pressure to explain and the pressure to perfect / What is inherently flawless, in all this / Recognize your right to push back…_
