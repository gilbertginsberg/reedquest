_ Trigger Warning: rampant sexism/heteronormativism_

“Shhh. What He Doesn’t Need to Know”
  
These days women talk way too much to their (strictly male and monogamous) mates. To pick up the slack in your jaw and your relationship, our leading sexperts have decided to add the old air of “mystery” back into your love life by telling you what he simply does not need to know. Men have noticed the difference and we have several company-owned psychologists to back us up on it, so deal.

1- “What You Do Nights Apart”
  
If you’re going out for a girls’ night on the town or curling up on the couch of your best friend’s apartment with a pint of Ben & Jerry’s to watch new episodes of Sherlock (my own personal favorite Friday night activity), whatever you do—don’t tell your boyfriend, cuz he don’t wanna hear it.
  
It’s best to give this a few days&#8217; radio silence ahead of time and after the fact so that he may actually wonder where you have been for the past week. This means no Facebook messages, no tweets, no tumbles, no texts, and God forbid you should call him.
  
With your actual, and honestly mundane, activities shrouded in mystery, he’ll begin to fantasize about your potential adventures: fighting Batman in a skin-tight cat suit, driving across the California desert in a red convertible with a large Samoan and a suitcase full of drugs, grocery shopping for him because he refuses to buy his own groceries or cook his own food. What a turn on for your lucky man.

2- “(Some of) Your Cool Skills”
  
You know, if you’re an excellent cook, you’d best not brag about it to your man—what’s cuter than seeing that genuine look of surprise when he bites into the first meal you make him? Of course, after a week or so, when you’ve exhausted your culinary talent, pick up something new to wow him with—you can’t let yourself become boring in his eyes.
  
Some men become incredibly irritated when they discover that their girlfriend has talents lying outside the bedroom, so keep your lip buttoned about your PhD in Mathematics.

3- “Your Skinnies Don’t Fit”
  
Lastly, when you’re on the floor struggling with the new pair of jeans that we told you would drive him wild, stick a sock in it, lest he hear you crying about being overweight. Like _legitimately_ crying. He doesn’t know you want to be a size 0 when you’re struggling to maintain a size 6, so why ask him to remind you how sexy you really are?
  
Remember, even if he claims to find you sexy as you are now, YOU ARE STILL NOT GOOD ENOUGH. Acknowledging this clear and present reality around your boyfriend will drop your sexometer to a negative 3 and he may see you as a “work in progress” instead of a whole person with your own issues and personal struggles.
