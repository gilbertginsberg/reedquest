Rumors that students have been evicted from their Reed dorms or apartments due to Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) policy violations have been circulating campus this week. According to Mike Brody, Vice President and Dean of Student Services, there is no truth to these rumors at all.

Brody and Pete Meagher, Associate Dean for Student and Campus Life, emphasized that the administration will always adhere to protocol that has been explained to the student body, one that, they note, is accessible to all students. Brody also mentioned that no individual has, or will be, disciplined in an unexpected way. Moreover, both administrators articulated that every circumstance involving student issues would be dealt with on an individual basis.

Brody also commented that students who frequently have issues with the AOD policy – especially if the students are not responsive to requests for communication on behalf of the administration – should expect  persistence from him. Brody is responsible for communicating with students who have received an AOD violation.

However, Brody noted that if students regularly violate policy, “the discussion evolves” and further action can possibly take place. No specific students were mentioned in the conversation, and Brody stressed that any information would be kept private.

The rumors appear similar to recent concern about community safety. Reed’s AOD policy has been more actively enforced by CSOs on campus since the beginning of the academic year as per directives from the administration and the board of trustees. While the administration and community safety has argued that it is simply following the rules that have always been in place, many students have asserted that in acting upon these policies, the administration is doing away with the Honor Principle and trust-based nature of the community.
