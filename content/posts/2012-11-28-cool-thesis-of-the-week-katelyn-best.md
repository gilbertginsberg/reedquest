Thirty years ago in Managua, Nicaragua, a group of students had an incredibly rare opportunity. After the Sandinista revolution, a school for disabled children was founded, bringing over 400 previously isolated deaf children into contact with each other. Initially having no language with which to communicate, the children interacted by making up their own signs and gestures, building their lexicon until they eventually had a common method of communication. The students had created a language from scratch.

Katelyn Best &#8217;13 is studying the phenomenon of Nicaraguan Sign Language, or NSL, and its relation to linguist Derek Bickerton&#8217;s Language Bioprogram Hypothesis for her thesis, which she is working on with Professor Kara Becker. Katelyn, of Eugene, Oregon, says that NSL may be informative on whether children have an innate, universal grammar already in their minds before they learn to speak a language, as Bickerton hypothesized.

The Language Bioprogram Hypothesis (LBH), Katelyn says, is a controversial linguistic theory about the origin of languages. Bickerton, a professor at the University of Hawaii, formed his hypothesis by studying creole languages. As Katelyn explains it, creole languages are a type of contact language ****found around the world, but largely on former European colonies, the nature of whose origins remain controversial among linguists.

A pidgin is formed when a dominant superstrate population, usually of European colonists, interacts with a substrate population, usually of slaves or immigrants who don&#8217;t speak the superstrate language. Trying to learn the superstrate language for its usefulness in the marketplace or at work, the substrate will learn basic words of the language that are adequate to communicate simple, work-related thoughts. This incomplete language is called a pidgin.

Katelyn explains that according to Bickerton a creole is formed when parents who speak a pidgin teach the language to their children. &#8220;The pidgin doesn&#8217;t fill all of the linguistic needs of the speaker,&#8221; Katelyn explains, &#8220;so the children take the pidgin and, using their own biological mental grammar, transform it into a complete language.&#8221; The creole may have similarities with the original superstrate language, but will be incomprehensible to the superstrate population because of its tweaked grammar (the vocabulary is usually mostly from the superstrate). Katelyn gives the example of reggae music to English speakers. &#8220;In a lot of reggae music they speak Jamaican Creole,&#8221; says Katelyn, &#8220;so it seems like you should be able to understand, but you can&#8217;t.&#8221;

According to Katelyn, Bickerton claims that creole languages offer a unique window into human linguistic faculties. &#8220;Basically, what motivated Derek Bickerton in formulating the LBH is that creole languages from many different parts of the world tend to have a lot of grammatical similarity,&#8221; Katelyn explains. &#8220;One example is that they almost universally have subject-verb-object word order, regardless of their substrate and/or superstrate languages. This is hard to explain, Bickerton says, if you don&#8217;t posit that universal grammar—which is the same thing that allows children to learn their native languages so well—is playing some role.&#8221;

Since deaf children without any linguistic input built Nicaraguan Sign Language, it is possible to see if Bickerton&#8217;s hypothesis that children possess an innate universal grammar applies. &#8220;Bickerton proposes syntactic features of innate grammar, and I&#8217;m seeing how many of these features Nicaraguan Sign Language contains,&#8221; says Katelyn. &#8220;What would be really exciting for the LBH is if NSL shared a lot of the same grammatical features that creoles tend to share.&#8221;
