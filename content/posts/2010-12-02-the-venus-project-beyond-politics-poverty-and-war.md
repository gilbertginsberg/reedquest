The Venus Project is an organization that proposes a feasible plan of action for social change—one that works toward a peaceful and sustainable global civilization. It outlines an alternative to strive toward, where human rights are not only paper proclamations but also a way of life.

The Venus Project presents a vision not of what the future will be but what it can be, if only we apply what we already know in order to achieve a sustainable new world civilization. It calls for a straightforward redesign of our culture in which the age-old problems of war, poverty, hunger, debt, and unnecessary human suffering are viewed not only as avoidable, but also as totally unacceptable.

Anything less will result in a continuation of the same catalog of problems found in today’s world.

The Venus Project presents an alternative vision for a sustainable world civilization, one unlike any previous political, economic, or social system. It envisions a time in the near future when money, politics, nationalism, and self-interest have been phased out. Although this vision may seem idealistic, it is based upon years of study and experimental research. It spans the gamut from education and transportation to clean sources of energy and total city systems.

Many people believe what is needed is a higher sense of ethical standards and the enactment of international laws and treaties to assure a sustainable global society. Even if the most ethical people in the world were elected to political office, without sufficient resources we would still have many of the same problems we have today. As long as a few nations control most of the world’s resources and profit is the final objective, the same cycle of events will prevail.

As global challenges and scientific information proliferate, nations and people face common threats that transcend national boundaries. Overpopulation, energy shortages, global warming, environmental pollution, water scarcity, economic catastrophe, the spread of uncontrollable disease, and the technological displacement of people by machines threaten each of us. Although many people are dedicated to alleviating those conditions, our social and environmental problems will remain insurmountable as long as a few powerful nations and financial interests maintain control of and consume most of the world’s resources and the monetary system prevails.

If we really wish to put an end to our ongoing international and social problems, we must declare Earth and all of its resources the common heritage of all of the world’s people.

Earth has an abundance of resources. Our practice of rationing resources through monetary control is no longer relevant and is counterproductive to our survival. Today we have highly advanced technologies, but our social and economic systems have not kept up with our technological capabilities. We could easily create a world of abundance for all, free of servitude and debt, based on the carrying capacity of Earth’s resources. With the intelligent and humane application of science and technology, the people of the

Earth can guide and shape the future together while protecting the environment. We don’t have enough money to accomplish these ends but we do have more than enough resources. This is why we advocate a resource-based economy.
