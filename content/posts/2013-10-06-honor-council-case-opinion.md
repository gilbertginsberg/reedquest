As you’ll read in today’s Quest, John Kroger has passed his duty of reviewing J-Board sanctions on to Mike Brody, Vice President and Dean of Student Services. From my perspective, as a former member of Honor Council, current senator, and member of the student body, this announcement presents serious cause for concern. As Anonymous wrote in “The Hollowing,” we are not perceiving the change, the slow current that is shaping the future of Honor at Reed-a future that is more administrative than autonomous, more process than Principle.   In and of itself, this passing off of duties is not an outstanding event, and I am sure Brody will do his duty in ensuring due process. I beg of you, however, to look at this with a more critical eye: to me, this is a prime example of the phenomenon of increasing administrative presence in the Honor Process. The shift itself is small, but it is one step closer to a new process that interweaves the Honor Principle, administration, and policy into one complex and warped “Honor Process.&#8221;

The Honor Principle implores thought and open dialogue to ensure that one interacts honorably with oneself, others, and the community. The President did not defy any code or constitution, nor did he break any policy with this change. My concern lies in the fact that this significant change in process was made without community discussion, and will go into effect regardless of the sentiments of the students. It is the students who will have to live with the effects and decisions this process-a process that is touted as autonomous and empowering for community members.  Our Honor Process has changed without any forewarning, let alone opportunities for input. In the wake of this administrative entrance to the Honor Process, does the student body still abide by and have recourse through an autonomous Honor Process? Do you trust the Honor Process as it stands right now? Do we still operate our own &#8220;autonomous&#8221; Honor Process?

Whether your answer to these questions are yes or no, we need to take ownership of the Principle and Process that are supposed to be &#8220;ours.&#8221; Be aware of the changes that are happening and stay informed. Keep the Honor Process accountable to how it&#8217;s used in the Community, whether that be by students or the administration.
