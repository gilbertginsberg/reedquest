Last year on May 5th during study week we, Nora Mullman and Dillon Nye, did something really, really stupid and potentially dangerous. We set a dorm trash can on fire in our friend’s room during the early hours of the morning, an action that is both in violation of the honor principle and, as we found out, illegal. Although we had no malicious intent, this by no means excuses our actions. We would like to stress that we did not intend to harm the residents of Naito in any way.

Because of the nature of our honor principle violation, the Portland Fire Bureau held an investigation and we were arrested later that day. After spending a day in Multnomah County jail we were charged with reckless burning and have an upcoming trial. The Honor Council held our hearing over the summer, and Colin Diver determined that community service both on and off campus, disciplinary probation for the next three years, and a public apology are all suitable consequences. We consider ourselves lucky to be allowed back at Reed.

We cannot stress enough how truly sorry we feel about what we did. We would specifically like to extend our sincerest apologies to anyone who has been involved in our case, including the residents of the room, Colin Diver, all of the Naito residents, the CSOs that were involved, and the Honor Council. We are terribly sorry to all of the Reed Community for violating the Honor Principle. We regret violating the trust of this community, as well as endangering any person who is a part of it. We are grateful to still be able to call ourselves a part of this amazing community and are working to make amends for what we have done to harm it.
