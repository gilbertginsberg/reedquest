Bon Appetite – the catering company that serves us food in the family room we call Commons – is contractually required to buy $6,500 worth of new dishes every year. In the past years, however, this cost has been much higher. Last year was the worst yet: the total cost for replaced commons dishes was around $38,000 dollars. That’s almost $32,000, or around 75% of the cost of one Reedie’s tuition, that went to buying plates, bowls and silverware. Fortunately, this year has seen a great turnaround. On November 16th of last year, Commons had already paid their $6,500 for new dishes, but Reed had to also pay a total of $8,472. This year, Commons still has had to pay their $6,500, but Reed’s cost has seen a big drop to only being billed $1,412.

“I don’t know if the students realized the full extent of what was going on,” says Peter Meagher, Associate Dean of Student and Campus Life, whose responsibilities include serving as the staff liaison to Bon Appetite. “We had lost a tremendous amount of money from lost dishes [and] whether those [were] stolen or… left somewhere else is not clear.”

Debby Bridges, Bon Appetite General Manager, noted that a single Commons plate costs three dollars. If all $38,000 went to replacing plates (though bowls and utensils have gone missing as well) that would mean 12,666 plates were lost. With an undergraduate student body of approximately 1,400 students, that results in almost ten dishes per student “vanishing” every year.

Certainly not every student took part in the planned or unplanned loss of dishes from Commons, but it nonetheless points to a problematic disregard for school property and funds. While students believe their tuition is going into paying for necessities such as professor salaries, last year a solid portion of funding had to be allocated to replacing dining materials.

This year has been different, and while the exact reasons for the sharp fall in lost dishes are not definite, there are a number of factors that administration believes contributed to this autumn’s success. The eco-container program began this year, and Bridges believes some 175 students have bought an eco-friendly container for the wallet-friendly $5 fee.

“The intent of the eco-container program is to encourage students to literally take ownership of the problem,” said Meagher, and Bridges noted that the fifteen-cent discount eco-containers give for every Commons purchase (meaning that after only 33 purchases the eco-container starts paying for itself) is probably a strong incentive. Furthermore, letting the student body know about the lost dishes issue from day one is also an initiative Bon Appetite has taken.

“When [all incoming freshman] had their first meal in Commons, Daxton [King, Bridges’ partner and Bon Appetite’s Operations Manager] and I spent time doing sort of a ‘Commons 101’ [with them]…and we talked about dish replacement right from that meeting – right from the get-go.” They also “put out in the [triangular Plexiglas advertisement holders] on the table information about the containers and the dollar amounts that Reed had to spend.”

Bridges was certainly pleased with the drop in costs, but she remains skeptical. When asked whether she thought the dip in misplaced dishes would persist, Bridges voiced her doubts: “I hope the trend will continue, but, you know, I’ve been here a long time. I know realistically that if people aren’t vested in making that dollar amount shrink, then it’s not gonna happen.” Perhaps Reed didn’t have a vested interest in the issue before this year, but if this downward trend continues, Bridges will be, I’m sure, happily mistaken.
