All retro sci-fi worlds need an unidentified flying object, and this year’s New World-themed Renn Fayre will have its very own crashed spaceship, courtesy of the Russian House and Erica Edmondson.__

The spaceship, which is Edmondson’s design, is one of the almost fifty projects that will be featured in this year’s Renn Fayre. This is a great improvement from last year when, due to students dropping out at the last minute, there was a dearth of projects. However, with one week to May 3, students still seem to be going strong.

Edmondson’s spaceship is, “based on a seminal Russian dystopian novel called _We.&#8221;_ In the novel the population of a futuristic society attempts to build a spaceship. That spaceship will crash land on Eliot Circle Friday night.

Edmondson teamed up with the Russian house to build the spaceship. She says, “I had a plan, and no people and the Russian department had people but no time.” Edmondson also cites the physics and math departments for being extremely helpful. She has wanted to do a Renn Fayre project since working with “Metal Arts” in Northern California over the summer, saying that she loves working with metal but it’s too expensive to do big projects on her own. Edmondson was given 700 dollars by the Renn Fayre Czars to build her spaceship and says that it will definitely cost every cent of that, even with budgeting.

The structure will be the broken off nose of the spaceship, jutting into Eliot Circle. Edmondson’s spaceship is about 300 square feet, will seat 15 to 20 people, and will be full of pillows and music. She’s planning on bringing in ambient and experimental DJs from around Portland as she wants “people to chill” inside. She does have a warning for those more adventurous Reedies seeking some nonconventional fun about the aircraft. “Please don’t climb on it. It’s not going to be easy to climb on, and while it won’t collapse right away, it wasn’t built to withstand that kind of weight and will get very dangerous very quickly.”
