In an email sent out to the entire Reed community Tuesday afternoon, President Kroger announced that a Title IX complaint had been registered regarding the nudity of revelers outside the first Hum 110 lecture. In an interview Wednesday, Sept. 11, President Kroger stated that, because the nudity was relatively public, the investigation will include discussion with individuals in an attempt to establish the indisputable facts of the case.

On Monday, the faculty passed the new Discriminatory Harassment and Sexual Misconduct policy. The DHSM addresses such nudity-related Reed traditions as the Naked Tree and RKSK. However, it does not address a matter such as the revelers before the first Hum lecture. Title IX of the Education Amendments, originally passed in 1972, addresses all aspects of sexual harassment and sex-based discrimination. As a supplement to Title IX, the Department of Education stated in a 2011 letter: “The sexual harassment of students, including sexual violence, interferes with students’ right to receive an education free from discrimination and, in the case of sexual violence, is a crime.”

In the past few years, several colleges and universities have come under scrutiny by the Department of Education for Title IX complaints. In the spring of 2011, Yale University received a Title IX complaint filed by a number of students citing several instances in which the university mishandled or ignored reports of sexual misconduct on campus. In one such instance, fraternity pledges stood outside the campus Women’s Center holding signs saying “We Love Yale Sluts.” In another instance, members of a fraternity marched through campus chanting: “no means yes, yes means anal.”

The process through which one would file a Title IX complaint is simple. The Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Education has instructions online. One must fill out a form asking for contact information, a list of the aggrieved, the name of the institution, and a description of the harassment or discrimination. One can mail, fax or email their complaint.

Although he couldn’t comment on how the investigation will affect the future of nudity at the college, the President said that there is a “difference between nudity that affects voluntary events” and nudity that affects the academic life at Reed. President Kroger encouraged the student body to reflect on how to co-exist in such an eclectic environment, and that what might seem like fun expression to one person is potentially triggering to another.
