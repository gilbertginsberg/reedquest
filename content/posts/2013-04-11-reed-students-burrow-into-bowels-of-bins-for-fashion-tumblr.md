If someone were to sit in commons for any amount of time, they would see the whole gamut of styles, from the monochromatic minimalists to the flamboyantly patterned dandies, from the sweatshirts of the Rugby bros and the robes of the Tir Na Nog-ites to the planned-out and perfected outfits of the fashionistas &#8211; and everything in between. Unsurprisingly, some Reedies have some thoughts on the fashion industry and how it affects everyday life, and have decided to do something about it.

[Bins Babes][2] – a Tumblr run by Reed students – is making waves in the local fashion and arts world.

Conceived by Alex Houston ’13 and her friends, Bins Babes takes popular looks from global runways and filters them through the chaos and crap of the Bins, creating a new aesthetic that simultaneously critiques, parodies, and celebrates the modern fashion industry.

The Bins is the affectionate appellation of the Goodwill outlet located just less than three miles from Reed, where the only law of the land is that if you grab it first, it is yours. Most items are priced by the pound, and delivered out to the retail space in giant bins that are begging to be rummaged through in search of cheap treasure.

Alex Houston ’13, is one of the experienced Bins hunters. “I&#8217;ve been a Bins enthusiast since my first trip there four years ago, when I found a onesie that fit me perfectly,” she says. “I washed it three times before wearing it.”

This love of the Bins was what originally led her and her friends to think up Bins Babes. “From then on, every time I went to the Bins I kept imagining ridiculous fashion statements that wearing clothes from the Bins could make. I was plotting a Bins trip at the beginning of last semester with some friends. We were re-hashing old war stories about all the silly stuff we&#8217;d picked up there when someone philosophized that really, Bins clothing is not much more ridiculous than runway fashion.”

To follow through with the idea of Bins Babes, Houston and her friends began monitoring the hippest fashion shows to see what the stylish elite were wearing. “I start out by searching out bizarre, terrible, funny, or even boring high fashion looks on the web,” she says. “Whatever makes me laugh, roll my eyes, or truly impresses me I save for consideration.”

The next step in the process is actually descending into the bowels of the Bins. She says, “I then head to the bins with about 10-15 looks in mind and search for items of clothing, scraps of fabric, or objects that have some relationship to the original outfit &#8211; same color, same pattern, same texture, etc. After washing the clothes, I recruit friends and people I know to do a shoot. Sometimes we use makeup, and other times I think it&#8217;s better to put a sheet over your head and call it done.”

As for the looks, they vary from dead on replications, to playful parody, to the occasional horrifying head-scratcher. Alex said there is no one message or aim that Bins Babes is trying to achieve, but instead a whole second-hand cornucopia of ruminations on fashion. “There&#8217;s definitely an element of commentary, but each look makes a slightly different statement. Is it a commentary on runway fashion? On the terrible things you can find at the Bins? In praise of the Bins? Blumarine, one of the fashion brands that I featured on Bins Babes, liked my Instagram post featuring a Blumarine dress&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure what that means,” she says. “It’s fair to say that Bins Babes embraces and celebrates the truly ridiculous, whether it’s the brilliant trash at the Bins or some runway concoction that makes you doubt the designer’s sanity.”
