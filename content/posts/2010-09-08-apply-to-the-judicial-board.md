Members of the Board hear and adjudicate cases concerning alleged violations brought by current or former members of the Reed Community. The time and work commitment varies widely throughout the semester and between semesters, and serving on the Judicial Board can result in a significant time commitment. Applicants must have completed at least one year at Reed.

Applications are due by 11:59 on Friday, September 10th to [Hannah Brannan][1] (MS 101), or to [Luke Fidler][2] (MS 322). Interviews will be held on the evening of Wednesday, September 15th, and applicants must additionally be available for formal Judicial Board training throughout the following weekend (September 18th- 19th).
