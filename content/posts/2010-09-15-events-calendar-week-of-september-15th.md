Winch/Capehart

We are the ninjas that you sensed in the night. With cold breath and fresh popsicles. Knowing too much about life, too much about our dreams, we are loose like hippos set free from a very tiny cage, no golden watches this time, just the future, like a big sticky web, wrapped around a very old man. Improvisation is the future, and we are here to slay the future in hand-to-hand combat. Comedy commences. Join.
