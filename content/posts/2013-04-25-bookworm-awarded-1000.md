Reed’s First Annual Book Collecting Contest awarded $1000 to first place winner Mack Sullivan ‘13. Richard Aldersley ‘13 was awarded $500 for second place. Francois Paultre ’13 received $250 for third place. The six other students who entered all received honorable mentions.

Book collecting made its way out of the depths of the library archives when nine students entered the contest. The Himes & Duniway Society, a Portland book collecting group, co-sponsored the event. Librarian Gay Walker, the first female member of the Himes & Duniway Society, spearheaded the effort to bring the contest to Reed.

Each entry included a short essay musing on the significance of the book collection to the collector and an annotated list of the books included, with short notes explaining their inclusion.

Sullivan’s collection is entitled, “How to Be Alone” after a book he once read. His essay begins: “I was deeply troubled by the questions it raised, and since then I have read widely and eclectically in the hopes of finding an answer to them,” Sullivan said. “The books in this collection have been chosen on the basis of their contributing to the answer I’ve finally come to.”

Aldersley, who is writing his thesis on Hemingway’s Nick Adams stories, entitled his collection “Ernest Hemingway: A Writer’s Education.”

“I entered the book collecting contest because over the past few years I have accrued a substantial number of primarily rare and uncommon books by or about Ernest Hemingway that, I thought, make a comprehensive and valuable collection of artifacts rather than a mere compilation of books,” Aldersley said.

A panel consisting of Walker, Professor of History and Humanities David Garrett, and Himes & Duniway member Scott Howard judged the entries. The winners were announced on April 15 at a small ceremony attended by President John Kroger, members of the Himes & Duniway Society, faculty, and administration. “Kroger became very interested in it,” Librarian Gay Walker said.

“In this day and age of electronics, some people will ask what relevance there is&#8230; I think maintaining that physical connection with the book is important,” Walker said. “It would be very sad for people to lose that connection to the book.”
