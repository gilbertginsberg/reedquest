A tale told by two idiots, with the sound – if not the fury – of the manic frustrations that face our generation,  _A Portrait of the Idiot as a Younger Idiot_ ran last weekend. Kyle Giller &#8217;13 starred as the younger idiot, after writing the play last semester. Funny and self-referential, the production was an exposé of the little known battle between invasive crust-punks and naturalized Portlanders.

_A Portrait of the Idiot as a Younger Idiot,_ directed by Beth Dinkova &#8217;13, opened with a monologue by the idiot as an adult. The stage was then occupied by Kyle&#8217;s adventures of finding mysterious unnamed women, starting an Iron Maiden cover band, and finding true love.

After being kicked out of his mother&#8217;s house after throwing a totally riotous party, the young Kyle moves to sunny Portland, where he discovers that whippets are a thing and that &#8220;grunks,&#8221; &#8220;skunks,&#8221; and &#8220;brunks&#8221; Occupy Everything. As his landlord, played by Aman Desai &#8217;14, points out, grunge-punks, skate punk-punks, and boiler-room crust-punks, have taken over the house &#8211; and Kyle is pushed out to the porch where his masturbatory habits are audible to the residents under the floorboards.

Boiler-room crust-punks, or brunks, are punks who rub a solution of urine and cocaine into their jeans in order to get that vintage look. They have been an invasive species since the Occupy Movement in 2011. Though known to occupy boiler rooms in particular, the play illustrates that brunks are keen to inhabit chicken coops as well. Fortunately for chickens, old people are usually bored enough to build them new coops.

Brunks often get in Kyle&#8217;s way, but their omnipresence helps at times. The brunks take care of Desai&#8217;s character as he recovers from whippet inhalation, but make him miss his opportunity to meet his unnamed female lover played by Gabby Chronis &#8217;15. Kyle goes to meet Desai&#8217;s lover and asks her to be Desai&#8217;s booty-call on Desai&#8217;s behalf. Although he is uneasy communicating with the female gender at first, Kyle eventually stumbles into good fortune when he meets his unnamed future love interest played by Ali Kafka &#8217;14. It was as if an occult hand brought them together through the intense love power of Iron Maiden.

Kyle stumbles across the stage and into many misadventures to which Portlanders can relate. At the end of this picaresque adventure, he takes responsibility for his own happiness. Reedies only live once. You have to be about it every day.
