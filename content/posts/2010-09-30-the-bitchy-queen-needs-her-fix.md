I want to rip something apart. Where are the missed connections? Enough said!

But since I can’t stop my self from talking, I am going to rant about how disappointed I was when I open my email Monday night and something was missing.

What the hell Student Body Info, where are the miss connections?!! The Diva has no reason to read SB info, if missed connections are not included. It is the only part I actually read, except if reading the table of contents, to see where the missed connections are on the list, counts. I don’t really care about the other things, if you want me to care send me a personal invite – DON’T FORGET THE GLITTER.

I need to laugh at the misfortunes of others, and the missed connections satisfy my fix. Some of them are just flat out embarrassing, some of you are just blunt (you know who I’m talking about, Ben Nortey fan), which just makes it that much more hilarious.  I enjoy reading your awkward, and sometimes creepy, outpouring of love and actually find it  somewhat encouraging. It is poetically miserable – that the rest of Reed is having, if not more, equal hardship as I am in finding love or getting into a relationship. Dating at Reed sucks. Don’t even get me started on this topic.

So I need my missed connections on Monday night, I don’t want to wait. It gets my week going to laugh at other people. Not that I don’t do that already throughout the week. It just makes it that much more entertaining when it’s in print.

So here is my missed connection:

I can’t stop staring at you, in the library, Commons or just passing each other.

Your dark hair, deep set eyes, quiet persona and awkwardness makes me like you even more.

Considering being human for a day,
