As students, we need to rethink what it means to work constructively with the administration.

With AOD issues and most recently sexual assault, students have started to engage the administration with less antagonism, more diligent dialogue.  However, it seems that when students collectively discuss complicated issues, like AOD or sexual assault, vocal reactions often drown out ideas of constructive cooperation.

Reed continues to be publicly mocked for entrusting students with such a high level of responsibility.  Internally, many students who are scared of change pass blame on Colin Diver and Mike Brody.

It might sound foreign, but why don’t we try to stand by the college’s public representatives when controversy emerges and prove our willingness to work with the administration.

We have hard-working, good-hearted people in the administration who defend students’ place on committees that decide policy and even hear student recommendations for judicial action.  When improvements to those institutional avenues are needed, such as additional professional oversight of sexual assault cases, how can students attack Brody and others for defending the student autonomy ideal that we all believe in?  This is unfair.

In his editorial last week, Senator Kahn emphasized the Honor Principle’s mandate that students approach each other with “discretion and consideration.”  This is true, and it applies to our actions towards administrators as well.

Changes at Reed are necessary and will continue to needed, but it’s dishonorable in the meantime to let the administration be thrown under the bus in the press and in campus discussions.

The Reed Union three weeks ago demonstrated a turning tide from self-righteous Reedie tirades to a desire for constructive dialogue.  There is an ongoing shift in student culture, one that realizes that the Honor Principle is a call to communal responsibility, not unfettered self-justification.

Communal responsibility entails defending the college against outside attack.  When controversy develops, students ought to get involved in finding productive solutions.

Student on committees making policy are in positions to take on the longer-term task of researching and implementing effective norms.  Members of Senate and Honor Council have potential to build bridges with the administration as they decide upon and voice student interests.

The student body as a whole can no longer demonize the administration while living in the illusion that we can do and say whatever we want.  As outsiders challenge Reed’s ideal of student autonomy, we need to prove time and again that we can have the maturity to make it work.

I urge students to both challenge and support the administration with increasing consideration for the college’s immediate and long-term betterment.  As Diver and Brody defend the college’s foundational principle of student autonomy to those outside, we cannot act as if the administration is a constant enemy.

Constructive student action requires more effective cooperation with each other and the administration. We must move in this direction or else quality administrators will burn out and Reedies will be alienated from each other.  We can do better.
