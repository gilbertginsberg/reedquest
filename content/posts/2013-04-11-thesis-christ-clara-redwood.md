Clara Redwood’s ‘13 thesis desk is littered with origami paper. Clara, the only girl who is strictly a math major in her class, is writing her thesis with Math Professor Irena Swanson on folding algorithms.

Clara, of Buffalo, New York explains that one could use folding algorithms, for instance, “when [they] try to figure how you can have a solar panel fold down into a tiny box and then fold out into space.”

Clara, on the other hand, is “writing an algorithm that turns a square piece of paper into an ellipsoid.”

Clara’s algorithm will allow one to input the three radii of an ellipsoid. The algorithm will then take those three radii and output a crease pattern that, once folded, will become a three-dimensional origami ellipse. The complication in creating an ellipsoid in contrast with a sphere is that in an ellipsoid, every curve is going to be different.

Creating an origami ellipsoid takes smooth folds – that is, a surface in the origami piece that stays curved through tension provided by several other curved elements.

Origami, in subtle ways, uses many advanced mathematical properties. For instance, according to Clara, mathematicians are obsessed with construction—that is, drawing lines and angles accurately. In origami, you can perfectly trisect an angle, or divide it into three equal parts.

Clara decided to write this thesis after having spent the last two summers researching with a professor who works with dynamical systems. This particular professor proved that a curved fold always exists in a single plain.

Swanson was assigned to this thesis, says Clara, because Swanson makes &#8220;mathematical quilts.&#8221; Clara, too, was drawn to a thesis that would have a physical product.

The thesis itself, Clara says, is half about the algorithm and the process of creating the algorithm and half about the restrictions to such an algorithm.

One of the major obstacles she had in starting her thesis was that she did not know how to program. &#8220;I had to teach myself how to program, considering the whole point was to write an algorithm,&#8221; she explains.

Clara says that there are many upsides to her thesis. First of all, she enjoys that her thesis has a physical product. Second, she enjoys the research aspect to her thesis; not many math majors get to do research. Finally, Clara says that she likes that she can talk about her thesis with a much larger amount of people than the average math major can—that is, her thesis is much more relatable for the non-mathematical portion of the population.
