Dear friends,

Sorry to all of you that wanted to safely divulge the details of your sex life in the newspaper, but we&#8217;re not taking your anonymous editorials anymore. The time may come when it&#8217;s necessary, but right now it only seems like it would enable insubstantial name-calling and outrageous claims.

Anonymity in journalism is a tough subject; while it can enable those in delicate positions to speak, it can also reduce the effectiveness and legitimacy of a piece. If one is not held accountable for a statement, there can be no repercussions in the event of false citations; what&#8217;s to keep a writer from simply inventing quotes?

Even without the use of anonymous sources, journalism requires deep integrity.

Unless every conversation is recorded, it&#8217;s hard to keep track of everything a source can say; one tries to note the best quotes as exactly as possible, but some are inevitably missed. If one didn&#8217;t write it down, can one be certain their source said it? The mind can play funny tricks.

And even when you have things word for word, it can be tempting to slip in a transition or correct a source&#8217;s grammar. It&#8217;s a fine line; if a quote isn&#8217;t placed in an article as it was given, does it really represent what that source meant? The best option, as I see it, is to steer clear of temptation and remain true to the text even when it doesn&#8217;t make for illustrious prose. The truth may not sound pretty, but at least it&#8217;s reliable.

At the Quest we want to at least be reliable; hell, we want to be legitimate.

Anonymity will push us to flame wars that don&#8217;t deserve to see print and are a waste of your student body funds. If you have a controversial opinion, at least have the guts to stand up and say it as if you were in conference. If you&#8217;re not prepared to face criticism then you shouldn&#8217;t say it at all.

Pug love,

Your Queditors
