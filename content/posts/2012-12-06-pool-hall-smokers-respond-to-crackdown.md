The nonchalant student playing pool with a cigarette in hand is under threat of becoming an icon of the good olde days. Although Community Safety’s policy has always been that smoking is not allowed indoors—pool hall included—this year, CSO’s have begun to crack down on it.

“A lot of people cling to a romantic or nostalgic Olde Reed idea of what the pool hall should be,” pool hall Manager Jesse Trujillo says. “A place where smoking and drinking should be allowed.”

Earlier this year, Community Safety posted comics on the walls of the pool hall in order to fuel dialogue around smoking honorably in the pool hall. This year, however, the CSO&#8217;s have adopted a policy of patrolling the pool hall twice during each of their shifts. If a CSO sees a student smoking, it is his or her job to tell the student to put out the cigarette. Director of Community Safety Gary Granger has announced a new no-smoking sign for the pool hall and will continue to push against smoking there until it&#8217;s no longer done.

According to Trujillo, most people that come to the pool hall are not there to play pool, but just to spend time in a relaxed environment. A forced reduction in smoking could alter the more lenient attitude of the space. Smoking has decreased this year, he says, although it still occurs every day.

“My view, as a manager, has always been that [smoking] is a positive thing for the pool hall because more people are attracted as it is a place they can smoke inside,” manager Kevin Schmidt says. “It’s my job to make this place attractive.”

On the other hand, it is the job of the CSO’s to patrol the pool hall twice during each of their shifts. If a CSO sees a student smoking, it is his or her job to tell the student to put out the cigarette.

“CSO’s have always stopped by and I haven’t really seen that change so much,” says junior Wesley Snell, who has been coming to the pool hall since his freshman year. “I think it’s totally fair, as long as it doesn’t escalate from there. The CSO’s are just doing their job.”

Still, Snell would rather the students decide what is honorable and what is not. As a regular smoker in the pool hall, he says, “I haven’t changed my habits, but I always ask. If there are people I don’t know, I ask and no one has ever said no.”

Honor Council hosted a discussion last month around smoking in the pool hall.

Despite his smoking habits, Snell doesn’t see smoking inside as defendable, as he recognizes it is against the law.

“I’ve been asked to be more adamant about keeping smoking out of the pool hall,” Trujillo says, “but I don’t feel as though my position entitles me to disallow people from smoking. I’m not going to assume the role of CSO.”

The ideal, Snell says, would be for non-smokers to let smokers know if they prefer them to stop.

“I totally would and I don’t know anyone who wouldn’t. But I also see how that could be uncomfortable for non-smokers,” Snell says.

A senior who regularly smokes in the pool hall, and preferred not to be named, has a more blunt view of the situation. “My moral sense says I shouldn&#8217;t be smoking, but my asshole self says I&#8217;m gonna do it anyway,” he told _The Quest_ last month.

Aaron Cholden-Brown, a regular in the pool hall who does not smoke, is in support of the crackdown on smoking.

“Eventually, it’s going to have to stop, and I think that time should be now,” Cholden-Brown says. “Given the other situations in which the Honor Principle is used, there is no rational argument for smoking in the pool hall.”

Snell, however, does not see the crackdown on smoking as an Honor Principle issue, but simply as Community Safety abiding by Oregon State Law.

“What would [Community Safety’s] response be if the students all came together and said, ‘We don’t really care if there’s smoking in the pool hall’ ?” Snell says.

Students aren&#8217;t punished much if they are caught smoking; nonetheless there is much at stake in the air Reed&#8217;s pool players breathe.

To Snell, the pool hall is the “last bastion of Olde Reed. I’d really hate to see that disappear,” he says. “It’s really special to me.”
