    <strong>The Low-down</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Everyone goes onto SIN and votes for their favorite organizations. After voting closes each group is ranked based on the number of Top 6’s, Approves, Disapproves, and Deep 6’s they received. The Top 40 organizations submit their budgets to Senate, and meet with them on Saturday to explain why they need student money.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    On Sunday Senate gets back together to discuss the budgets and split the available student activity funds between the Top 40. No one is guaranteed funds; much more money is usually requested than is available, and Senate has refused to fund organizations in the past. It may do so again.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If your organization does not make the Top 40 or Senate refuses to fund it, do not lose hope. Senate will hold weekly Finance Committee meetings, where they will distribute the remaining student body funds. These are great for smaller organizations and events that groups have just decided to host.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Clear and concise budgets will greatly increase your chances for funding. Senators tend to skip reading large blocks of text, and they’ll appreciate it if you give them the straight facts. And bring libations.
