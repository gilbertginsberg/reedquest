The mere mention of “stem cells” can trigger heated arguments about when life begins and whether stem cell research is moral. Stem cells have the power to regenerate damaged tissue, but they also have the power to form an entire organism.

With several cases that could restrict biomedical use of stem cells currently moving through the federal courts, the stem cell controversy isn’t going away anytime soon. Advocates insist that the only moral course is to exploit these cells for scientific and medical breakthroughs while critics question the ethics of harvesting and destroying cells that represent a potential life.

Research with adult stem cells seeks to circumvent these issues. You see, embryonic stem cells aren’t the only stem cells available. Populations of cells capable of generating multiple types of differentiated cells persist even in adults, and are appropriately termed “adult stem cells.” Embryonic stem cells (and some adult stem cells under certain conditions) can create any type of cell required to form a complete organism (a property called pluripotency). Nearly all adult stem cells can only produce multiple, similar cell types (a property called multipotency). For example, the regions of our brains that form new memories contain a small subset of adult stem cells that produce only neurons. These are neuronal stem cells. Data accumulated over the past decade suggest that some neuronal stem cells are actually differentiated, mature cells with functions other than simply supplying new neurons. One such cell is the specialized support cell in the retina called a Müller glia.

A recent paper from Pamela Raymond’s lab at the University of Michigan examined the properties of Müller glia. These cells are well-known for physically supporting neurons, insulating them from their neighbors, and clearing extracellular debris. The most recent studies provide evidence that Müller glia also exhibit adult stem cell properties. Raymond and colleagues show that in zebrafish retinas these glia proliferate slowly and can give rise to rod photoreceptors (one class of light sensing cells at the back of the eye). In response to light-induced damage, Müller glia proliferate rapidly and produce all types of photoreceptors, including the cones that we use to perceive color. This demonstrates that Müller glia are multipotent, and are capable of responding to environmental signals to alter their fate and produce specific cells to aid in recovery of the retina.

It is worth noting that cellular reactions to damage differ between mammals and fish. In mammals, damage to the central nervous system often results in “reactive gliosis,” in which glial cells proliferate to form a protective scar. This process efficiently restores the integrity of the boundary between nervous and non-nervous tissue, but can also prevent neuronal regrowth, resulting in long-term loss of function. Going forward, it will be important to determine how fish circumvent reactive gliosis and whether Müller glia represent a source of adult stem cells in mammalian eyes.

Adult stem cell research moves us closer to the possibility of therapeutic treatments for degenerative diseases. A previous Science Savvy, “[They Once Were Blind, But Now They See][1],” described how sight was restored in night-blind mice with retinal stem cells from embryonic retinas. In that context, cells harvested from newborn mice were used, a procedure not applicable to humans. With a deeper understanding of Müller glia, however, it may be possible to induce cells in the host to repair damage and create new cell types without the need for injections of embryonic cells. The more we learn about the signals that encourage stem cells to proliferate and repair tissues, the more power we’ll have to induce specific cellular behaviors and potentially repair damaged or degenerating tissues.
