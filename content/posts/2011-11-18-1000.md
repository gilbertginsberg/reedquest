Even after writing three Hum papers, a small group of freshman activists have resisted the urge to lose sight of life outside the bubble. Reedies For Somalia (RFS), founded this year by Erica Maranowski ’15, has been gaining presence on campus over the last semester. Their biggest event so far will be a presentation and discussion tonight (Thursday, November 17), which will include a 13-minute documentary and a talk by a local high school student who grew up in Somalia.

Though Somalia briefly enjoyed the spotlight of international media this summer when António Guterres, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, dubbed the drought in Somalia “the worst humanitarian disaster in the world,” it has since been forgotten. This month, heavy rain and flooding have compounded the effects of insecurity and famine. According to a November 4 press release by UNICEF, there are 450,000 acutely malnourished children in Somalia, and a total of 1.5 million children “in dire need of humanitarian assistance.”

Maranowski says that knowing people who have been personally affected by the disaster has been a source of motivation for her. The speaker at Thursday’s event, Mostafa Abdul Kadir, is a friend from Jefferson High School in North Portland. It was there that Maranowski began planning the student group that eventually became RFS.

“Reed has grown politically stagnant to some degree,” says Maranowski, “though that’s the case with most of society unfortunately.” Nonetheless, she (rightly) guessed before coming that she would find interested people at Reed. She began telling other freshmen about her idea during Orientation Week. Many seemed interested, and about a dozen students are still active with RFS.

Even with those small numbers, Maranowski is confident that the group can organize something substantial. Earlier this semester, RFS set up an information booth in Commons and added 63 people to their mailing list. They have also applied for a New Voices grant, an initiative from the Multicultural Resource Center to encourage student projects addressing issues of privilege, identity, and diversity. Maranowski humbly insists, “We’re all freshmen, so we’re still adapting to being here.”

Though they have their own ideas about a large-scale fundraiser they are planning for the spring semester, they wish to discuss their ideas with those who attend Thursday’s event before finalizing plans.

At their weekly meeting in the SU loft, the discussion seems productive. They want to be sure that there will be “nothing gruesome” in the documentary that they will screen, and worry about supporting charities that only offer “band-aid solutions.”

RFS will host their presentation and discussion tonight (Thursday, November 17th) at 6:30pm in Eliot 314.
