As part of an increased effort to move the campus towards more sustainable policies, Reed will begin to participate in the city&#8217;s public composting program. The curbside service will only apply to residents of the Birchwoods, Reed College Apartments, Garden and Farm Houses, and select Language Houses.

Senator Marie Perez, whose Economics thesis investigates Portland’s new composting program, originally proposed the idea. Perez met with Townsend Angell at Phys Plant, who she describes as being “way into” the idea. Senator Annam Swanson, a member of the Res Life Committee, formed a composting subcommittee with Roland Wu. The program directly impacts both Swanson and Wu: Swanson is a resident of the RCAs and Wu the House Advisor for the Spanish House.

Residents of the participating on-campus housing locations will be using the 64-gallon green “Portland Composts!” roll carts. These carts can be used for yard waste as well as food scraps. However, the city asks residents to research what can and cannot be composted. Portland’s government website warns against any plastic “compostable” products that are not on the approved list. Perez stresses that any trash or incorrect material put in the bins ruins the entire load and, if not caught by city workers, could contaminate all of the compostable material on the waste management trucks. In this instance, the compostable material would necessarily be moved to general waste.

“We now have recycling, glass, trash, and compost,” says Swanson, “and we need to be sure we’re sorting everything correctly.&#8221;

The city’s waste management policy for composting is currently limited to fourplexes and smaller living arrangements, according to Perez. Portland’s curbside service is still a pilot program, which accounts for the limited availability on the Reed campus. Swanson and Perez agree that if the program proves to be successful, it could potentially expand to more on-campus housing. However, this will remain contingent on the willingness of the city to work with varied housing units. Residents of Reed’s apartments, co-ops, and language houses are ideal candidates, says Swanson. These students cook more often and thus are expected to make significant use of the program.

In the past, Swanson “hauled her compost to Commons,” where students can leave compost, but expects this development to lead to more widespread participation. This sentiment is echoed by Heidi Whitehouse, HA of the RCAs: “Reed students are busy&#8230;We _can_ do it on our own, but the current system has low visibility and is not infrastructurally salient.”

Whitehouse says that the residents she has been working with have been proactive about the logistics of the composting program.

“I’m really happy about it,” says Whitehouse, “I imagine a lot of people throw away compostable items and don’t realize it.”

Whitehouse also expressed satisfaction that the program is being well facilitated while not invasive to those who do not want to participate. In Whitehouse’s words, the program could be “a great success, or a great success with three people.”
