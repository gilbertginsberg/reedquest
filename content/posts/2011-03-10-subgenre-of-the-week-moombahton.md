Have you ever been to a skipping party? Until today, I’d never heard of them before. Maybe it’s because I wasn’t all that hip in high school (oh, hey, free periods spent in the library), but apparently while I was sitting in my morning calculus class and longingly looking out the window at the sunny day outside, cool kids my age were busy getting shwastied.

For those you who, like me, were nerdin’ out in the A.M., a skipping party is when you throw a party at your home mid-school day by informing your buddies in the morning that instead of suffering through U.S. History they’ll be chillin’ at your crib, guzzlin’ a brewski and getting C-R-U-N-K. Sounds like typical teenage debauchery (who else is interested in getting super smashed before noon on a Wednesday?), but it was during one such party that the magical subgenre of Moombahton was born.

Dave Nada, the DJ behind electro act Nadastrom, decided to help out his younger cousin – who was a frequent host of skipping parties – by providing the tunes for one such gathering in late 2009. After seeing the crowd, who were really into the bachata and reggaeton that Nada’s cousin and friends were dropping on the soundsystem, Nada knew that his usual electro-house tunes would not fly. If he didn’t want to get shanked by the partygoers, he needed to play something with more of a reggaeton feel.

Fearful for his life, Nada made a quick decision that ultimately marked the birth of a new subgenre. Taking some of the tropical/Dutch material he had on CDs, he slowed Afrojack’s “Moombah Remix” down to 108 bpm “and the place went insane!” gushed Nada in an interview with Fader magazine. The unusual blend of genres was a surprising hit, and things got so rowdy that the cops were called in over noise complaints.

“Shit was just too much. I was losin’ it and told myself, I need to make some edits of this shit! And thus, Moombahton was born,” said Nada in an interview.

Nowadays, you can find tons of Moombahton remixes online – they range from Lil’ Jon to Yeah Yeah Yeahs to Barbara Streisand – and every track is danceable and fun. It’s perfect party music for spring break in warmer climates, so if you’re headed south in March, be sure to pack your iTunes library with a number of these tracks before catching some rays. And even if you’re stuck in the cold, wet north, take it as an excuse to crank up the heat, throw on a swimsuit, and shake it like nobody’s business.
