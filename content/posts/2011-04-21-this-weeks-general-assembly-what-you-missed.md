Tuesday’s Reed College Student Body General Assembly was a chance for the Reed community to come together and address issues that they feel are pertinent to the community. While we, the organizers, accept that the assembly was by no means a perfect forum to deal with all the issues that the students brought up, we were happy with how the overall discussion went. We were honored and pleased by the large number of students who attended, the respect students showed each other, how passionate those who attended felt about the issues that were being discussed, and the overall quality of the discussion. We believe that moments like these are desperately needed to bring more dialogue into our community and provide for democratic moments of self-realization as members of the student body.

The main issues that came to prominence in the initial round of discussion were sexual assault, AOD policy, the relationship between the student body and the CSOs, the Honor Principle in regards to the law, communication in the community, campus property being disrespected, and smoking on campus.

Because so many people felt that the issue of sexual assault was the most important issue facing our community right now, most of the assembly was focused on discussing this. With regards to sexual assault, the main questions students brought up were as follows:

What are J-Board and Honor Council’s roles in the process of dealing with sexual assault cases?

Do students who deal with sexual assault cases have adequate training?

If sexual assault cases were taken outside of the community would this help make Reed safer or simply lead to a disempowerment of the student body?

Should the names of those who are convicted of sexual assault be publicized?

Should those people who are convicted of sexual assault be banned from campus completely?

How much should the federal/state legal code apply to cases of sexual assault at Reed?

Do we need to redefine our community’s definition of sexual assault/consent?

Do we as a community have a responsibility to help those who have been convicted of sexual assault?

Bathroom graffiti about sexual assault can be damaging to members of the community, but does its prevalence point to a feeling of disempowerment in the community regarding how sexual assault is dealt with?

Since the issue of sexual assault was so important to those students who attended the General Assembly, there wasn’t enough time to get to other concerns and issues which students brought up. We are therefore hoping to hold another assembly to discuss these things, and would love for the community to send suggestions on how to improve the assembly as a forum to [&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6c;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x67;&#x65;&#x2e;&#x67;&#x65;&#x6e;&#x65;&#x72;&#x61;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#x61;&#x73;&#x73;&#x65;&#x6d;&#x62;&#x6c;&#x79;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x67;&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;][1].

Thanks to everyone who came and helped us make this an interesting and informative discussion!
