    Last week, an article called “Bathroom Confessional” ran in the Quest &#8211; opening with a brief description of a new California law allowing transgender students to use public bathrooms of their choice, denouncing it as eliminating a women’s safe space, and then proceeding to sing the praises of women’s bathrooms in creating a shared aspect of women’s culture – and I am absolutely baffled as to why.

    I’m baffled because this article fails to meet any proper standard for not only lack of blatant bigotry, but also argument quality, or even relevance to the Reed community as such. Its failure in making an argument becomes apparent within the first two paragraphs, which after describing the law make some leap of logic (counter to actual facts) that these bathrooms will now be entirely gender-neutral, while nowhere managing to explain how the subsequently- described horrors of removing all gendered bathrooms is actually related to said law. The reader is thus forced to assume either authorial incompetence, or filling in the leaps of logic that would require the argument to make sense, authorial transmisogyny. Because how else does one move from “trans people can use bathrooms congruent with their genders” to “women’s bathrooms are now gender-neutral and no longer safe spaces for women”? The only way I can think of is to tacitly assume that trans women are in fact men.

    I may of course be wrong on this particular note; nonetheless, it is equally rankling to see later on statements of how all women use women’s bathrooms – which, combined with the argument that women’s bathrooms are safe spaces, implies also that they are such for all women. These claims once again deny trans women their womanhood, or at best simply forget about them, and the fact that no, many of them do not find such places to be safe, largely because of the efforts of other women to push them out rather than invite them in.

    So the question then is – what value does a piece such as this even potentially bring to the community? I fail to see any relevance it could have that would warrant inclusion in our paper, given its apparent impetus of a law not affecting Reed campus, and the lack of any similar topic presently in campus-wide discussion that would benefit (and I use the term loosely) from this opinion’s presentation to the community. Thus, for no particular reason whatsoever, the Quest has apparently decided that its use as a platform to show content trampling the identities and need for safety of myself and other trans and/or nonbinary individuals, to the entire community of which we are a part, is acceptable.

    I profoundly disagree.
