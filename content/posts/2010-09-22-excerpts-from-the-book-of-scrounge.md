The following excerpts have been pieced together from pages found on the floor of Commons. Members of the Quest have suffered through lengthy debate over the use of such holy texts in such a lowly newspaper. We hope that the included texts will serve to provide some instruction to those not yet familiar to the traditions of the Scrounge._

[From Genesis]

In the beginning when He created the heavens and the earth and the Commons, the earth was a formless void and the Commons was a barren land. He said, “Let there be light, and a dome in the midst of the waters, and some lights in the sky, and some plants, and living creatures, and humankind.” He saw that these things were good. And while He rested, this man and this woman, made in the image of the Creator, began to view all that He had offered them, roaming naked through the plentiful isles of Commons. There was much to behold, but humankind did not appreciate the value of foodstuffs. Woman bit from an apple, and gave but a bite to Man before throwing the fruit to the ground. Thus humankind was banished from the Commons, not allowed to return until one and all could give food the respect it deserved.

[From Exodus]

So William Abernathy climbed down to the Canyon in the 1986th year of Our Lord. There, William saw Him in the shape of a blinding blue light. He said, “If those that wander the Campus wish to eat the bountiful foods and live the prosperous life, you must deliver unto them my words. It is through my words that you will again enjoy the fruits of Commons.” William chiseled the words into the stone tablets called the Quest. These words became known as the Scrounge Commandments.

  1. Thou shalt not wrest thy bread from the tray of another without first asking. There are few who object to the Scrounge on certain principles. To these brothers and sisters, we must turn our cheek.
  2. Thou shalt not place the remnants of thy feast upon the trays of the innocent without first asking. Those brothers and sisters that constitute the Boarders shalt not be considered a giant conveyor belt.
  3. Thou shalt not covet the trays of those who have not yet eaten. Jeers shall not be shouted at and puppy eyes shall not be given to those Boarders who have yet to finish their meal. It is good and right to wait for our brothers and sisters to finish before taking their offerings.
  4. Thou shalt not impede the progress of slopping. Thou must make use of the prizéd tool, the fork, most speedily to allow others of the Scrounge to access the foodstuff.
  5. Thou shalt not table scrounge. In respect to those that serve the food, and to those who have made its purchase, those of the Scrounge shall stay in the Honored Position beside of the Great Tray Return. We must uphold the position of the brothers and sisters who came before us.
  6. Thou shalt not give gruff to the Boarders. It is wrong to be rude to those brothers and sisters who have provided the Scrounge with sustenance. It is right for others to chastise the Scrounge if any gruff is given.
  7. Thou shall protect the house of the Scrounge from the great plagues. Brother and sister Boarders should tell the Scrounge of any ailments they might have. It is wrong to bring these plates of food to the Scrounge. We must protect our brothers and sisters.
  8. Thou shall not spoil the food He hath provideth. To use thy food as an ashtray or to plough salt into the furrows of thy mashed potatoes is an act of blasphemy. While the food of the Boarders belongs to the Boarders until they give it to the house of the Scrounge, it is right for all to respect their brothers and their sisters.

[From the New Covenant]

…And with the years came many changes in accordance with His will. Among these, the rise of the prosperous tribe of Bon Appetit from the ruins of the heathen SAGA. Led by prophets of Dilliplane and Brody, the children of the House of the Scroungers returned from exile at the edges of the Garbage Can to their rightful land along the oak-bound banks of the Scrounge Table. It was upon that glorious homecoming that this, the New Covenant, a trust of fellowship and solidarity, was forged that all of us, His hungry daughters and sons, might receive the nourishment we need to sing His praises by way of our academic endeavors to elucidate His ways, that we might be fed.

And it was good.

To seek out sustenance in the return trays of the far-off Café and to share thy famished brothers and sisters is right and good.

To remove food from the Scrounge Table for thine own consumption alone is an evil deed, for it has been decreed that such food is communal, and of that slice of pizza we all desire a bite.

It is only just to eat of the board card while thy funds last and to leave the offerings upon the Scrounge Table for those without, and know that thou wilt be welcomed joyously into our ranks once thy card has nothing to offer thee.

To honor the Scrounge and your fellow children of its house is the highest act of praise. If thou art sick, thou should get thyself a bowl and a pure utensil for transfer of food from plate to bowl, and also use a separate, unclean utensil for transfer from bowl to mouth. So too must we all maintain our altar clean and tidy that we never again find our house in exile.

The House of the Scroungers is a loving one, and has been blessed with a fine memory. Thy alms of Scrounger-friendly foods such as quesadillas, fingers of chicken, rice and beans, and the much-coveted vegetable assortment will not soon be forgotten, O freshling — thy charity will be repaid by an old can of PBR, perhaps, some Friday night in the pool hall, when we find ourselves weighed down with the icy, malty, delicious fruits of an expedition to the holy oasis of The Sev some weeks hence. His graces will come unto thee, if thou only hast the patience.
