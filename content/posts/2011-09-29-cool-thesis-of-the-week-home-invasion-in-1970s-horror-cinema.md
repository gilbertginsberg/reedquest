_Each week, The Quest profiles the thesis of one senior whose work is worth sharing with the Reed community. The purpose of this column is to increase awareness among Reedies of the work being done in various academic fields and to make disparate forms of scholarship accessible and understandable to all._

It&#8217;s a common scary story, the basis of countless urban legends: Someone finds herself hounded by a creepy antagonist who singles her out as a victim. Just when the victim thinks she&#8217;s safe, she learns the attacker is inside her own house. Nowhere is safe.

The home invasion narrative was a staple of the Gothic tradition, and gained significant popularity in the horror cinema of 1970&#8217;s America, says Emily Symington of Washington, D.C. In her English thesis, “&#8217;The Call is Coming From Inside the House&#8217;: Home Invasion in 1970&#8217;s Horror Cinema,” which she is working on with Professor Jay Dickson, Emily explores the cultural and psychological roots of this theme as well as its influence.

Rooted in the ideal of suburban life as a central element of the American Dream, the importance of the home has long been a point of reference in American literature and art, says Emily. During the shocking cultural changes of the 1960s, she continues, much of conservative middle-class America “attempted to shut themselves in, away from all the violence and upheaval.” The home became a symbol of this isolation: They were “trying to shut out evil,” Emily explains, “they thought they would be safe in their houses.”

The MPAA rating system had been put into effect in 1968, replacing outmoded censorship laws and independent film directors were given more freedom in the post-studio era, so Emily says directors “had a lot more room to experiment&#8230;to do what no one had done before.” Previously, “evil” had very obviously meant “other,” Emily explains, because it had always been “something that you&#8217;re supposed to be able to detect.” In the 70&#8217;s, however, directors like John Carpenter, Wes Craven, Roman Polanski, and William Friedkin realized that the more real and relatable a fear was, the more effective it would be in their films. Thus, “evil” in movies shifted from zombies and monsters to stalkers and murderers. Directors “wanted real monsters that weren&#8217;t cartoony,” Emily explains, monsters “that you could imagine walking around.” The psychological equation of safety and the home was therefore something they could take advantage of, making home invasion a perfect theme for movies like Carpenter&#8217;s “Halloween” or Fred Walton&#8217;s “When a Stranger Calls” (a quote from which provided the inspiration for Emily&#8217;s thesis title).“The home invasion is where&#8230;someone (or something) has come into your safe haven,” says Emily: “There&#8217;s no way to lock the door against something that&#8217;s already in your house.”

This theme influenced other movies that weren&#8217;t explicitly about home invasion. In Roman Polanski&#8217;s “Rosemary&#8217;s Baby,” for example, Emily says, a husband&#8217;s betrayal of his wife to the Devil implies that one is not even safe from one’s own family; in “Nightmare On Elm Street,” Freddy Krueger is able to attack the protagonist in her own dreams, in an experience Emily calls “the ultimate invasion.” This legacy can also be seen today in films about insanity, disease, and societal corruption, in which “something that&#8217;s already in your house”—whether that house be our whole culture or one&#8217;s own body or mind—becomes the enemy within.

There is also a political element to the era&#8217;s horror cinema: For example, Tobe Hooper has stated that his film “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” is really about Watergate, and the Charles Manson murders of the 1960&#8217;s also created a context for films that highlighted killers living among us.

However, Emily says, this will not be the focus of her thesis. She believes that “some scholars have gone too far” and “over-politicized” horror cinema, which takes the credit away from what makes it great. Instead she will focus on what she loves about the films she is writing on: “Overanalyzing it like that takes away from the fundamental fact,” she says, “that these directors just wanted to _scare_ people.”
