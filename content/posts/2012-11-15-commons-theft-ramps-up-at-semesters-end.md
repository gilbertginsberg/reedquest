Every day, approximately $100-200 of food is stolen from Commons. This is a recurring problem, and at the end of the semester, theft tends to be especially prevalent. One likely contributing factor is that students run out of board points, according to Vanessa van Staden, operations manager of Bon Appétit at Reed.

“If the chef makes 100 portions and we only sell 50, we know that there is theft,” van Staden says.

Van Staden is out on the floor during all meal times, during which she sees students hide food in their bags. While employees ask these students at check-out if they have any other items to buy, they do not call them out on stealing.

“We ask them, and it’s on the honor system. We’re not the police; we don’t want to be the police,” van Staden says.

Prices at Commons have increased this year by approximately three percent – mainly as a result of theft, according to van Staden – although the increases are also due to market values of crops.

According to Van Staden, price increases also keep Bon Appétit from giving their employees raises, as they don’t have the money to do so.

“It’s hard to watch people walk out with food when I have watched the employees work on it all day and then not be rewarded,” van Staden says.

Students do not experience repercussions for stealing from Commons, because they are expected by Bon Appetit employees to act according to the Honor Principle.

“Although I mostly eat from the salad bar, I’m right on track or below,” says a student who asked not to be named. “It’s not feasible; it’s really hard to live off of what they expect you to eat. So I steal a snack sometimes.”

“I don’t think it affects Bon Appetit,” van Staden says. “I think it affects the community. I know we’re a corporation and we’re viewed as ‘the man.’ But the impact goes further than that.”

Still, some students see the immediate situation as flawed.

“The system in place at Commons is almost dishonorable,” an anonymous student says. “If Commons wasn’t an independent corporation—if it was a part of the school—they would be more concerned with providing food for us.”

Stealing from Commons, however, may cause increased prices in the long run, which directly impact students.

Says van Staden, “I hope they know they’re hurting themselves more than the corporation.”
