“Reedies often forget to interact with the real world,” says Erika Kurth &#8217;12. While Reed enjoys a relatively high level of tolerance on campus, students can easily forget that this is not the case in the rest of the world.

This is why, Erika, of San Antonio, Texas, decided to use her thesis production to raise awareness of issues of gender and sexuality equality that are still prevalent in the real world. Erika&#8217;s interdisciplinary Literature-Theater thesis, which she is working on with Professors Kate Bredeson and Anne Delahanty, deals broadly with “theater as a tool for social change.” Like all Theater theses, it comprises a written portion and a production, which showed last Saturday.

The written portion is an examination of the Bread and Puppet Theater, a socially critical street theater troupe from New York and later Vermont in the 1960&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s. Bread and Puppet was founded in New York City by Peter Schumann as a vehicle for protest against the Vietnam war, and became famous for its use of large puppets in theater productions and protest marches. This was useful for the group to stand out from other protests, says Erika: “Of course it would gain a lot more attention than just people marching down the streets.” The group&#8217;s “most iconic” puppets, says Erika, were 10-foot-tall effigies of blank-faced Vietnamese women, intended to call attention to the human side of the war. Another recurring character was “Uncle Fatso,” a parody of Uncle Same that represented America and capitalism. In the 1970&#8217;s, Bread and Puppet moved to the Vermont countryside, where it put on its “Domestic Resurrection Circus,” a three-day festival of social and political theater and art. “Pageants” were presented at the bottom of an outdoor amphitheater, with the audience seated on a hillside overlooking the stage.

Inspired this, Erika decided to present her own show on Reed&#8217;s front lawn, which has a hill of its own. Erika&#8217;s show, “The Fantastical Genderfuck Circus,” which was a collaborative project on the part of all involved led by Erika, began with a parade processional from the Theater building to the front lawn. With Erika in the role of ringleader, holding up signs to describe the narrative, the play then chronicled the story of Ze, an ungendered character named for the pronoun “ze,” which was invented to replace “he” and “she” as the only two options for referring to unnamed human subjects. Ze goes on to learn about “zirself” as ze moves around a stage divided by a line of white tape, with a “male” side and a “female” side. Ze is instructed by the audience to sort according to gender a selection of objects, including a pink dress, a football, a toy batman, and a toy lobster. (Erika says she does not remember which gender the audience ended up deciding to assign the lobster.)

Ze then goes on to meet a series of characters, beginning with the Dragon of Identity, who tells Ze that “you will learn” who ze is. Ze then meets Goldenrod the Moonchild, who wears a two-gendered mask and refers to themself as “they.” Goldenrod teaches Ze the word “love,” and how to love zirself as well as friends and family. Ze then meets MixxScarlet, a gender-bending drag queen, who calls herself “she” and teaches ze the word “fuck.” MixxScarlet “teaches Ze to fuck the binary, fuck expectations, and do what you want,” says Erika. Ze then meets Mama Jade, who is referred to as “we,” and teaches Ze the word “grow,” as in “growing within yourself an identity” all your own. Ze&#8217;s final encounter is Lazuli, who refers to oneself as “one.” Lazuli teaches Ze zir final word, “be,” as in “be yourself; accept yourself; be as you are.” Finally, the Dragon of Identity returns and asks Ze again who ze is. “I am Ze,” Ze replies, to jubilant chants of “Ze has found Zirself!” from the rest of the cast.

At the end, bread was served to the audience as a tribute to Bread and Puppet Theater, which did the same thing in accordance with Schumann&#8217;s belief that “you can not feed the soul when the body is hungry.” Erika says she saw the bread as a symbol of the audience “coming together as a community, breaking bread together.” She goes on, “I&#8217;m so proud of it; everyone did a fantastic job.” Erika says she hopes her play left her audience “more aware of different issues” of gender and sexuality. “Even though we as Reedies don&#8217;t face these problems everday,” she notes, “they exist in the world around us.”
