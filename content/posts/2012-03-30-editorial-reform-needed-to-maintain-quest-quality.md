The quality of _The Quest_ has fluctuated wildly in its near century of existence. In recent years, it has published everything from coloring contests to articles on Pet Parade titled “Pawsitive Reinforcement.” _Quest_ Board elections too often deteriorate into popularity contests and do not guarantee a high quality _Quest_.

The method of choosing _Quest_ Editors needs to move away from elections in order to establish institutional memory and to ensure that editors are chosen because they are qualified, and not because they are marginally more popular than their competition.

We propose that _Quest_ Editors be chosen through a system of internal appointments, in which they follow the same ideals they do every week, transparency, objectivity, and fairness, in choosing new editors themselves. Editors will use a consensus-less-one voting system to appoint new members, a method that Appointments Committee currently uses to appoint student body positions. The appointment process will be observed by a _Quest_ outsider to further ensure that the _Quest_ Board does not become nepotistic. New editors may be appointed in the middle of a semester if the _Quest_ Board loses editors.

The _Quest_ Board will still be subject to recall by the student body if Reedies feel that editors are abusing their editorial control or otherwise failing to produce a _Quest_ that balances journalistic integrity with Reed’s élan vital.

A set minimum number of Queditors will be established to guarantee both a diverse and large enough _Quest_ Board to do the job. While some past _Quest_ Boards have consisted of three or four editors, consistently publishing a _Quest_ with timely investigative journalism, or journalism at all, requires a larger board. We started this semester with seven editors and have already lost one to a leave of absence. Every week is a struggle not just to fill _The Quest_, but to fill _The Quest_ with good journalism. When the truly important story does strike–student arrests, student patrol officers, or Title IX investigations–it’s essential that _The Quest_ is able to cover it skillfully, else the student body will be unable to make informed decisions.

We hope that our proposal will ensure that the _The Quest_ is capable of reporting the challenges that face the student body.
