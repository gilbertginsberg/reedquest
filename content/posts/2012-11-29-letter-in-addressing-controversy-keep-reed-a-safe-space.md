_**By Neil Anderson**_

About a week after his [Saturday night display in the Student Union][1], a significant portion of the Reed community holds the belief Sal Rodriguez did not violate the Honor Principle. Although the question of Rodriguez&#8217;s potential violation is by the definition of the Honor Principle open for discussion, I find our hesitant consensus on the matter or lack thereof highly dismaying. Although Rodriguez claims to have sent some of us away laughing, many others were outwardly offended, and it seems that in the aftermath, some of us stand caught off guard by Rodriguez&#8217;s brazen comedic timing, unwilling or unable to give the responses his display deserves. To that end, I&#8217;ll attempt to address two points, firstly Rodriguez&#8217;s use of the slurs, and secondly claims that his behavior warrants no apology as audience members have a way of shutting down the performance or leaving, should they find the material too offensive.

Regarding use of the n-word and other slurs, I speak from personal experience when I say that a person outside a marginalized group defined by race, gender, sexual orientation, mental/physical disability, age, class, or other means necessarily lacks the experiences needed to fully identify, by inference, the thoughts and feelings of members said group. Rodriguez defends his public use of the n-word (and other slurs), on the basis that it was a joke. But regardless of intent, his directed use of such hateful slurs, particularly in a public setting, is not a joke unless every person present personally confirms they actually received it that way.  It&#8217;s clear that many were hurt and offended by Rodriguez&#8217;s remarks, and from this offense the comedy club setting offers him no exemption.

Everyone present may have had the ability to just leave, but not everyone did. In the following, I can only speak from my experiences. Has anyone ever verbally abused you? Has anyone ever pressured you, in- or unintentionally, explicitly or implicitly, into inaction? In the moment it&#8217;s not equally easy for everyone to just say no, just not listen, or just leave, especially subject to paralyzing, hateful language, regardless of its original intent. Although the audience members Saturday night may have possessed the physical ability to walk out, boo Rodriguez off stage, or pull the plug on the whole system, they didn&#8217;t. The reality of addressing a diverse audience is that whether or not the performer is sincerely doing comedy, not all the audience members have a way of shutting the performance down, and those who don&#8217;t possess the means for whatever reason should not have to depend on those who do. While Rodriguez may have expected to get a bigger rise out of us all, his intentions do not excuse his actions. This is not about comedy, free speech, or personal liberties. This is about ensuring that Reed College is for all as equally safe and welcoming a place as possible.
