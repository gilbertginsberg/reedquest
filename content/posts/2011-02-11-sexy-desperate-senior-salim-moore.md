Looking for [sexual preference]: A woman.
  
Looking for [relationship/casual encounter/etc.]: All of the above.

**What makes you S(D)S of the Week?**
  
I am a good storyteller and besides, I hear Black people are in this month.
  
**
  
Est-ce que tu aimes les jeunes filles qui parlent le francais?**
  
Ouais, bien sûr! Aussi, le russe, l’espangol, l’allemand, le chinois, le japonais&#8230; you get the ide.

**Of all your hairstyles, which one has been your favorite?**
  
Natty dread locks
  
**
  
Valentine’s Day is coming up. Got any plans?**
  
Yep. I’m going all out this time.
  
**
  
Poison of choice?**
  
Mandrake root

**Are you more about wining-and-dining or hitting-it-and-quitting-it?**
  
Wining-and-dining-and-hitting-it?
  
**
  
Do you self-identify as a Bro?**
  
Chillax brah! Why you gotta make this difficult?

**Favorite music to play while making sweet, sweet love to a woman?**
  
I have never had the opportunity to make sweet, sweet love to a woman over music.
  
**
  
Feelings towards Cher?**
  
I’m not very familiar with Cher. Now, Loreena McKennitt on the other hand&#8230;

**Got your eye on any particular Reedie(s) right now?**
  
Sure, sometimes I wish I could be all-seeing like Argus Panoptes and other times like the blind like Zatoichi.
  
**
  
How does it feel to be regarded as the “official face of Reed?”**
  
Sometimes it gets on my nerves.
  
**
  
What justifies the strikethrough in “desperate”?**
  
I asked kindly?
  
**
  
Care to expand on your freshman-year nickname?**
  
When I was a freshman they called me the “Prospie King.” I never asked to be called the “Face of Reed” or any other variations on that theme. Now they call me something else entirely&#8230; I have not approved of any of these titles.
  
**
  
Fave Queditor (PICK MEEEEE)?**
  
Well, let’s see, En-Szu I suppose.

I play music and make art. I also work on Canyon Crew, that’s the best one really
  
**
  
Favorite musical subgenre?**
  
Fantasy Metal.

No idea.
