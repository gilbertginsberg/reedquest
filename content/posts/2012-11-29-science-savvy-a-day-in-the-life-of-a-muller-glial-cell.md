_**As told to Miranda Lyons-Cohen and Rachel Yahn.**_

Dear Diary,

Today was tough. I feel so much pressure to be perfect. My parents are always going on about our cousins (the radial glia) up in the hippocampus and superior colliculus in the brain, telling stories about how researchers discovered their crucial role in the formation and maintenance of synapses. Synapses are basically cellular bridges that connect adjacent neurons and facilitate communication and are really important. Scientists thought that maybe we Müller Glia played a similar role in the retina. Today I learned of the final results of some recent experiments.

In this study, Philip Williams and his colleagues made me fluoresce by making me express green fluorescent protein (GFP) so they could visualize me and my other glial friends with a microscope. The first test was easy. Scientists wanted to take a closer look at the relationship between me and my roommate. They removed him using a laser, and it turns out he had been regulating my size our entire lives. Once he left I got huge! And look, I’ve got pictures to prove it (modified from _The Journal of Neuroscience, 8 September 2010, 30(36): 11951-11961)_.<a href="http://www.reedquest.org/2012/11/science-savvy-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-muller-glial-cell/muller-glial-cell-pics/" rel="attachment wp-att-1862"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1862" title="Muller Glial Cell" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.reedquest.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/muller-glial-cell-pics-270x300.jpg?resize=270%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>

These results suggest I could regulate cell-cell interactions. Maybe I could also regulate the synaptic cell-cell interactions between two neurons, just like my cousins in the brain. We Müller glia cells have a tendency to grow into the outer plexiform layer (OPL) of the retina where we come in contact with sensory neurons (photoreceptors) and interneurons (bipolar cells). For visual perception to occur, photoreceptors must detect light and then quickly send that information onto bipolar cells. They in turn pass it along to other neurons that send the message to the visual processing regions in the brain. In previous studies, Müller glia have been shown to wrap around photoreceptor-bipolar cell connections, raising the hypothesis that Müller glia like me could play an essential role in forming the actual synapses connecting photoreceptor and bipolar cells. If this were true, I could finally get my parents off my back about finding my purpose.

To test this idea, scientists put our retina under a microscope and correlated movies of Müller cell growth with those of synapse formation. These time-lapse imaging experiments suggested that I didn’t expand into the OPL to help form these important connections. There was still hope that maybe a small part of me had grown into the OPL and helped with synaptogenesis, but that hope was dashed when I learned the results of their definitive experiment. The scientists used a dye that labeled all of my membranes, including the finer processes that might have been excluding the GFP in my cytoplasm. They found that no part of me was in the right place at the right time to help out with synaptogenesis in the OPL.

In their last effort, the scientists tested whether we stabilized newly formed synapses. They removed a few of my friends just as they were beginning to grow and mature. The researchers observed no differences in synapse formation and stability in regions with or without Müller glia. How disappointing.

I’m clearly not like my cousins in the brain who play an essential role in synaptogenesis, and my parents will have to accept that. I know I’ve got an essential function, and hopefully in a few years scientists will figure out just how important I am.

Until then,
