When I first met Philip Metres, I was surprised by the ease with which he spoke of _Abu Ghraib Arias,_ his heart-wrenching book of poems and winner of this year’s Arab American Book award for poetry. __In the hours I spent listening to his experiences writing the book, however, I realized that this ease sprung was rooted in his view of torture as a reality, not a horrific image constructed by the news.

Metres, an award-winning poet and professor at Cleveland State University, effectively moved his audience to tears, laughter, reminiscence and an honest discussion of global human rights in his reading last Thursday, November 8. Metres read primarily from _Abu Ghraib Arias_, a collection of poems that collages quotations and stories from the of Iraqi prisoners and American guards in the 2004 Abu Ghraib prison scandal. _Abu Ghraib_ _Arias_ includes poems inspired by a selection of texts from the Gitmo Standard Operating Procedures manual, torture victim testimony, words of U.S. soldiers and contractors, religious texts, and news stories.

At a question and answer session before the reading, Metres explained some of his motives in writing the poems that appear in _Abu Ghraib Arias_. “I want my poetry to stand in testament to what happened, both to myself and the world I live in…The most important thing for me was to make the readers feel the movement of the utterance of testimonies, and in the presence of soldiers trying to rationalize actions. They are hard to read. It’s not fun reading. It’s not a place you want to go.”

One of the most controversial aspects of Metres’s work, and one that occupied a large portion of the discussion with students, was his decision to include events from the perspectives of the soldiers who were directly involved in the acts of torture. One student asked whether or not he was afraid of humanizing the torturers. Metres answered, “A year after working with the testimonies, I found the language and stories of the soldiers were important. They were undeniably a part of the conversation which is the act of torture. Ultimately, the book got better when I added the soldiers because it became a dialogue. I’m not afraid of humanizing. I’m afraid of the opposite, of demonizing them. If we do that, then we say that they’re not us.”

For Metres, poetry is a political device, a means to give voice to the voiceless. “The political was inescapable for me. I wanted to make sense of things that I don’t understand,” Metres explained. “The only way to write is to drive writing towards questions you want to explain. I feel very strongly that there are voices that are not heard, and it’s a lie to say that they don’t exist or that we don’t hear them. It’s our job to keep listening to what they say about themselves, and in turn what they say about us.”
