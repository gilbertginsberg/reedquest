Though Reed’s Sustainability Committee has $13,000 in reserve, it does not have any plans to spend it. The committee, founded in the spring of 2009, has been “a dead horse” for much of its life, says Senator Marie Perez ’12, Senate liaison to the committee.

The Sustainability Committee has not yet met this year, and currently exists largely in name only. Last year, it met only three times and did not have an offical chair. Ed McFarlane, vice president and treasurer of the college, was the original chair of the committee but says that he does not know when or where the committee meetings will take place this year.

Students or faculty can submit proposals to the committee that promote sustainability, but because the president’s office provides half of the committee’s funding, the project must receive presidential approval. Few projects were approved under the Diver administration despite the surplus of funds, the other half of which are paid for out of Student Body Funds. Perez says that despite the committee’s environmental motives, only projects that were also of financial benefit to Reed, like the replacement of standard light bulbs with energy-saving CFLs or the installation of programmable thermostats, have been approved.

After Diver refused to approve projects, some students suggested that approval be controlled by students. Whether President Kroger, who did strong environmental work as Oregon’s attorney general – even recieving an endorsement from the Sierra Club during his election – will take a different approach remains to be seen.

In addition to disorganization, the committee has also faced a lack of feasible project proposals. Committee meetings last year were not publicized, and when Perez reached out to students in her position as liaison, she received no response. Perez claims students are no longer as interested in local environmental issues as much as global ones and considers the lack of project proposals a sign of student apathy.

“Reedies are so preoccupied with committees&#8230;if you want to do something, you should probably just talk to your friends and do it,” says Perez. “Townsend Angell, the director of physical plant, will probably make the biggest impact on this campus&#8217; sustainability this year. Not because some committee pressured him, but because he decided that composting in the Birchwoods and RCAs was a good idea and should be considered and tested. It remains to be seen if it will happen, but the point stands—committees are not always the fastest, most efficient means to effect change.”
