    In the Congo in the time of King Leopold II, Belgian colonists and companies brutally exploited indigenous Congolese peoples in the name of “civilization.” Such is the premise of Joseph Conrad’s <i>Heart of Darkness</i>, a Victorian-era novella that is touted in academic circles as a scathing criticism of racist imperialists. But with her thesis, Heidi Whitehouse ’13 points out that Conrad’s novella may not be as anti-racist as academics are prone to believe—and that, in fact, Conrad’s language bolsters the racist language of the Victorian Era.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Whitehouse, from San Diego, California, is working on her History-Literature thesis with English Professor Pancho Savery and History Professor Margot Minardi. Asked to sum up her thesis in a sentence, Whitehouse says, “My thesis is about how racial depictions are encoded and subsequently treated within the academy and within American pedagogy.” Heidi is specifically looking at <i>Heart of Darkness</i>, which was published as a serial in 1899 and later as a book in 1903.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Heidi says that with the book, Conrad “discusses the atrocity and depth of economic exploitation of Congolese people that took place under this colonial regime.” Heidi argues, however, that “he also in many ways upholds—at the same time as he critiques this massive genocidal crime against humanity—the rhetoric and ideas of imperialism at that time, specifically English imperialism.”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Part of Heidi’s thesis will explore this tension between Conrad’s anti-imperialist ideas and his language. “What Conrad does is, while he censures King Leopold and his clearly genocidal immoral enterprise, he uses profoundly racist language. That alone is problematic, even still today, because it’s dehumanizing—it’s a very dehumanizing rhetoric that he uses,” Heidi explains.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For example, Heidi says, in one passage Conrad paints the picture of native Congolese men who are put in a chain gang and forced to work. “He uses this really sympathetic language of these men who are criminals to no one, who have committed no crime, are just being treated as criminals and forced to work for some random people that just came into their territory with guns, took their wives captive. The way that he depicts it, any reader can have sympathy for these men,” Whitehouse says.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yet, she explains, Conrad simultaneously uses bestializing language to describe these men. “They’re wearing loincloths, and they’re tied in such a way that it makes tails on the men that wag to and fro. And he describes them as beasts numb to torture,” she says.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “And so even while he’s doing this thing that causes audiences to be very sympathetic to the people portrayed, he undermines your ability to believe that they’re people, he kind of turns them into beasts of burden who are numb to abuse. And you totally lose your sympathy, your connection to this people. So it’s like, what are you trying to do here? Why?”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Heidi argues that Conrad’s language tends to undermine his intentions because of his background. “Conrad himself did go to the Congo as a colonist. He was working for a Belgian company. And he himself saw with his eyes how jacked up the system was,” Heidi says. “But because he was an Eastern European—he was Polish—who became a citizen of England and just was growing up with this pervasive rhetoric of imperialism…I think he basically just couldn’t strike it from the record. I think he was incapable of sincerely becoming a multiculturalist, anti-racist human, let alone writer,” she says.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Heidi also believes that the fact that English was Conrad’s second language may also have been a factor. “I think it’s significant too that he didn’t learn English until he was twenty…He was fluent in English, but because it was a foreign language to him, I think the human Conrad specifically was particularly susceptible to the racist rhetoric that was dominant [in Victorian England].”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In a letter to his publisher, Conrad himself argued that “The criminality of inefficiency and pure selfishness when tackling the civilizing work in Africa is a justifiable idea&#8221; for writing the book.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    “I was drawn to that quote, because I think it&#8217;s kind of tragically ironic that so much canonical criticism and so many traditional approaches to teaching this book completely overlook fundamental comments concerning social justice that Conrad wanted to address” Whitehouse says. “And that, to me, is ‘criminally inefficient.’”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Heidi’s thesis includes two more parts: one in which she explores “how critics who write about this novella—of which there are many—deal with [Conrad’s] weird, ambivalent, shifting ideology there,” and another in which she investigates how that translates into a classroom environment.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The latter part, Heidi says, is drawn from an experience she had in class at Reed. “I had a really weird experience as a sophomore in Hum 220 where we read the novella for one class and we discussed it in conference, without the issue of the profoundly racist language of the book ever coming up. And when one person—also a History-Literature major—brought that up and said we’d been talking about this book for an hour and a half without addressing how profoundly racist this book is, people in my conference reacted really vociferously to that. Basically, they didn’t want to talk about that—that it wasn’t relevant, that Conrad was a man of his time and ought to be exonerated on the grounds of his anti-colonial message from charges of racism,” Heidi says.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The experience caused Heidi, who says she wants to become a teacher, to feel as though she had “unfinished business with Conrad.” She says that through her thesis, she wants to come to some conclusion about how the novel should be taught in class. “I want to come to conclusions about ‘<i>This</i> novel should be taught <i>this</i> way,’ I don’t want to be all liberal-artsy about it and end up writing a thing where it’s like ‘Conrad is <i>this</i> but he’s also <i>that</i>! At the same time, whoa, isn’t that complicated?!’ and come to no solutions,” Heidi explains.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Heidi adds that she doesn’t “want to go extending experience I had in the past, in 2010, to all of Reed College, let alone the English-speaking world.” However, she says, “I’m personally invested in coming to conclusions about how should we teach texts like this. How should we engage with white terrorism, which still exists today?”
