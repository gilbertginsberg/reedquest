_**By Sam Law, Greenboard**_

This semester, Greenboard is launching a campaign asking Reed to divest their endowment from fossil-fuel companies. The campaign will join hundreds of others across the country, taking part in a national movement of people who believe it is neither honorable nor wise to profit our education is likely subsidized in part by the profits of the very fossil-fuel companies that, if allowed to continue unhindered, will make that education useless. There are no jobs on a dead planet, as the saying goes.

Yet, in recognizing how we are actively benefiting from resource extraction, we also become aware of our extraordinary position of privilege. Those who are already facing the worst effects of climate change are the  communities who have been marginalized and made vulnerable by long histories of colonialism, violence, and poverty. One need think only of the weeks it took for aid to come to the Rockaways, Queens after hurricane Sandy, a neighborhood predominantly made up of poor people of color. The reality is that those who are most affected by climate change are also from an industry that is destroying the planet. This movement’s membership is already made up of an impressive list of  individuals and institutions, including over 200 campus divestment campaigns, the city of Seattle, Secretary of State John Kerry, Nelson Mandela and even former Reed President James L. Powell (1988-90).

Why? Because to stay below the 2°C of warming that scientists agree means massive catastrophic climate change, fossil-fuel companies need to keep 80% of proven reserves in the ground. The danger becomes especially clear when you realize that extractive industries operate with only one concern: profit. Historically, they have shown a flagrant disregard for the people, cultures, plants and animals at sites of extraction. Now, the financial value of their companies is based on projections of future earnings that shows a fundamental disregard for the planet.

But to paint a Manichean narrative with the evil profit-hungry fossil-fuel companies bent on planetary collapse somehow removed from us, the good members of the Reed community, with our recycling, our canyon, and our (occasionally) locally sourced food is far too simplistic. As of 2010, Reed College had $374 million invested in a non-transparent endowment. However murky the endowment may be, it is likely that a substantial portion of it is invested in fossil-fuel companies, either through direct ownership of stock or investment in co-mingled funds that include fossil-fuel public equities and corporate bonds. This means that the least able to address and respond to the crisis. As members of the Reed community, we are connected to a large amount of financial capital and thus can affect these companies’ bottom lines by divesting the sizable amount of money Reed has invested in them.

Aside from the economic effect of divestment, this action will send a powerful message about the moral bankruptcy of fossil-fuel companies. We know that we must conduct ourselves with honor and fully analyze the impacts of our actions not just within our conferences but also in the world at large. Divesting in fossil-fuel companies that are destroying our planet is one step that the Reed Community will have to take if it is truly committed to being an honorable member of the global community.

Anyone in the Reed Community, be it students, alumni, faculty or staff, interested in participating in this campaign is welcome to come to Greenboard’s next meeting on Thursday at 6pm in the Blue Heron Infoshop. Feel free to send the campaign emails at [&#x64;&#x69;&#x76;&#x65;&#x73;&#x74;&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x67;&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;][1] and stay tuned for a semester full of divestment related activities.

This is not to say the struggle will be easy. Last time there was a national divestment campaign, around apartheid in South Africa, students at Reed College gained national attention when hundreds occupied Eliot Hall and eleven students were suspended. The prospect of a sustained student campaign might be intimidating. However, it is important to remember that we did not choose this fight but it chose us and that we, as members of the Reed Community and children of this planet, are already involved. Wisdom can be found in the strangest of places and so I will end with a exchange from the _Lord of the Rings_ movies: _“I wish it need not have happened in my time,” said Frodo. “So do I,” said Gandalf, “and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.”_

**Editor&#8217;s Note:** _The _Quest _will be looking into Reed&#8217;s endowment this semester. College officials with experience of the endowment say the investment structure is complicated and divestment would be difficult._
