_A Response to “Granger Responds to Recent Jabs, Increase in AODs”_

No, Gary Granger is not a cyborg assassin. However, a growing number of students perceive his implementation of the AOD policy as highly dishonorable.

It has been obvious over the last year or so that the way the CSOs interact with students is changing. This change is most obvious to students through the increase in AOD violations and increased vigilance with which the CSOs look for a situation in need of one. There are reasons for that; Reed College has received external pressure to decrease drug prevalence on campus, and to change Reed’s public image. Without some changes, Reed College could lose much of its funding; 56% of students here receive financial aid and much of that could be lost if federal funding is cut. AOD violations are not what students have a problem with.

Indeed, Gary is not the one removing our funding and he did not make Reed’s policy; he is only doing his job. What is not okay is the way the CSOs are being told to interact with students. I can’t even play a game of pool with a CSO anymore!

Recently, students have seen the CSOs less as community members and more as inquisitors. The CSOs are community safety officers. Does patrolling dorms and hunting down small time drug use make our campus safer? This question has been asked before and many students say “no,” but the student body as a whole has not reacted yet.

Regular CSO patrols have begun in dorms, primarily ODB and Bragdon. Students should be the ones looking after the dorms, taking responsibility for our own space, and calling the CSOs when they are needed. Instead, patrols are justified with thefts and suspicious persons in the dorms. We appreciate having the CSOs around when they are needed for these occurrences but the CSOs react to these events by telling us that we need them to be in our living space to keep us safe. So far all that seems to have come from these patrols are more AOD violations. AOD violations are not themselves bad for our community, but I would hope that the CSOs would be honorable in their actions. If sniffing out AOD violations is what Gary wants the CSOs to do, the least he could do for the students is tell it to us straight.

Once we lose trust and transparency between students and CSOs we are no longer a community. Many students, myself included, came to Reed not because of the amazing academics, we could get that at some preppy east coast school if we wanted. We came here for Reed. We came for the crazy quirky brilliance of every Reedie, but we also came to Reed because we saw the students, the CSOs and the administration cooperating and interacting as equals. We saw everyone bound by honor and respect. Something about that has changed. People are saying that the CSOs are not acting honorably; and it isn’t just the stoner smoking out the SU. It is every Reedie who sees The Honor Principle losing its place in our community.

Granger informs us that “the Honor Principle presupposes voluntary compliance with established rules, regulations and policies.” What does that mean to him? He hasn’t been entirely clear on that point, but his interpretation seems to be: if you are not abiding by the law you are acting dishonorably. I would have read this quote to be a statement of innocence until proven guilty. In any case, I have another quote for Gary, also from the Preamble to the Honor Principle. “The Honor Principle mandates maximum reliance on individual judgment and conscience and minimal enforcement of rules and regulations through surveillance.” Is that what we have? Increased CSO patrols, students calling the CSOs to deal with their pot-smoking neighbor? We used to have the honor process to deal with that. If anything, I hold the second quote as closer to the heart of The Honor Principle than the first, but it seems to have been brushed aside. Gary knew that he had his work cut out for him when he came to Reed, but having a hard job doesn’t mean he can disregard what makes Reed Reed in order to get it done.

AOD violations are not the problem; the problem is the changes that are occurring in how this community operates, and the effects these changes are having on the role of honor in our community. Gary says that the opposition to his implementation is from a minority group who is not willing to have a dialogue. I sincerely hope a minority is not all who are concerned about this, and I know for a fact that a dialogue is what the students want.
