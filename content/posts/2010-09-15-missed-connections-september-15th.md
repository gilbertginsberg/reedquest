[#5] I’m growing tired of playing games, lover of mine. It’s time for the ironic baseball caps to come off, you sexy piece of Texass. How do you say “cuddlehumps” in Greek?

[#6] To L.:
  
I adore your dark aura. It drives my soul off the brink&#8230; Take my
  
modest advances, and respond as you, the lady of the night, see fit.
  
Eternally yours,
  
Library Admirer
  
P.S. You’re fit.

[#7] Luna Lovegood,
  
You know who you are. Everyone who you speak to falls in love, but they don’t admire you like me. Stop alphabetizing in the mailroom and find me. I will show you true magic.

[#8] Blonde, shaved on one side. SOOO HAWT. I want to see more of you. You are to my loins what a lemon bar at commons is to my stomach.

[#9] Girl with the blue hair. Freshman. Rock my fucking world.

[#10] To: Ben Nortey
  
You’re super cute + quite the badass. Do you still have that girlfriend back home?

[#11] He was dressed like a kindergardener but he looked like a sexy 43-year-old. I could stare at his dreamy unshaven face and gaze into his deep librarian-style-glasses clad eyes, hazel with a glint of somber sensibility. As he poured me out my coffee he exuded such maturity and good Jewish breeding that my heart was aflutter. I’ll come to the p-dox every Sunday at six with the hope that one day, finally, he will notice me. <3

[#12] How tall are you? Tall enough to have the stars in your eyes. You seem miserable. Let me make you happy. 😉 😉

[#13] To the boy with the same essence as my boyfriend&#8211;I need a supple, innocent replacement when my boif is occupied with thesis woes. Don’t let the age difference throw you off &#8211; I can teach you the sensual pleasures of “olde” Reed. Bring your signature white thermal and broody brow and let’s get started.

[#14] I  told you to find me after Thesis Parade. You never did. Don’t  make me wait another year to take you home.
