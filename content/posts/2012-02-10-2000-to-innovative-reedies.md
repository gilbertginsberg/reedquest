    According to a National Public Radio interview, Fernandez and Krishnan have been developing Emotitron for over two years, since they got the idea for emotion-detecting technology when they watched the movie “I, Robot.”

This past Sunday a team of three Reed students and two Portland high school seniors won the Reed Start-Up competition with a business platform for software that can analyze human emotions using voice patterns. Team Emotitron consisted of Reedies Finn Terdal ‘13, Clemmie Wotherspoon ‘12, and Gabriel Forsythe-Korzeniewicz ‘12. The Reedies were joined by Matthew Fernandez and Akash Krishnan, the seniors from Portland’s Oregon Episcopal School who invented Emotitron.

The team formed last Friday at Reed Start-Up Lab, a Working Weekend event during which Reed students and community members developed start-up plans with the help of mentors, many of whom were Reed alumni. “We met [Fernandez and Krishnan] at the event,” explained Terdal. “I hadn&#8217;t heard about them beforehand, but quickly discovered that they were as driven as they were brilliant.”

Emotitron and the six other teams participating in Reed Start-Up pitched their idea to a panel of angel, venture capital, and incubator investors on Sunday night. Emotitron’s first-place win garnered $2,000, which the members divided among themselves, as well as a workspace at Portland Incubator Experiment’s offices. They also won the opportunity to attend a summer session at the Portland Seed Fund, which helps new companies by mentoring them and investing in them. The second place winners, team Ha.Lo, won $500 to further develop their idea for a smart plug that reduces &#8216;vampire&#8217; power loss and increases safety.

According to a National Public Radio interview, Fernandez and Krishnan have been developing Emotitron for over two years, since they got the idea for emotion-detecting technology when they watched the movie “I, Robot.” Their software has won multiple technology competitions since then, including the Siemens Competition in Math, Science, and Technology in 2010.

Terdal explained that “Emotitron is capable of analyzing emotional cues from audio input in real-time.” The technology has many possible applications, from directing angry callers to staff at call centers to helping the military detect emotions across languages. The team, however, has a distinct focus. “We… currently plan to develop it as an assistive technology for people with autism, parents of children with autism, and educators,” said Forsythe-Korzeniewicz. This application lies within his realm of experience: For a long time, Forsythe-Korzeniewicz has been working with people who have developmental disabilities. “Besides the explicit ways in which this technology may become assistive and educational, the great thing about this project is that it is something that can bridge differences between people with and without developmental disabilities in a fun and cool way,” he said.

The teammates expressed interest in continuing to work with each other. “It depends mostly on Fernandez and Krishnan as they decide what they want to do after graduating from high school,” said Forsythe-Korzeniewicz, “but it seems likely that much progress will be made on the product in the coming months and that a company will develop around it, possibly with the assistance of the Portland Seed Fund.”
