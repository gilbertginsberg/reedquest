Music and dumpster donuts drew students last week to the HotBoxx, where a house show celebrated the reincarnation of the arts and politics zine _Praxis_. This year’s first issue of _Praxis_ includes poetry, political analyses, and art – all by Reed students. While the zine will be published monthly, originally _Praxis_ was simply a weekly newsletter. The word “praxis” signifies practice as distinguished from theory, but editors Andrew Barney and Spenser Silbey say that the central goal of the zine is to produce good art.

“I’ve lately come to see art and literature as types of praxis,” Silbey says.

Silbey explains that in past generations, art and politics have been closely connected. He cites the connections between surrealism and communism, symbolism and anarchism, even the colors of political parties on CNN maps. Art, Silbey says, can influence how we approach our politics.

“I want people to see that radical politics and art are not mutually exclusive,” Silbey says. “I want people to have a venue for their art when they didn’t have one before. I want to break down the divide between politics and art.”

Silbey says that he does not want _Praxis_ to be a platform for propaganda, which he says can lead to terrible art. The use of art in politics “is a discussion that a lot of anarchist and communist groups are having right now,” he says.

Barney stresses that students at Reed have the capability to publish their work; it is only a matter of taking action.

“A lot of people at Reed have good and progressive ideas. A lot of people at Reed have ideas that they think are important,” Barney says. “But few do anything about them, and it’s not hard to do at all.”

_Praxis_ is seeking submissions in the form of analyses of current events, political essays, reviews and critiques, poetry, very short fiction, humor, and visual art, as long as it can be printed in black and white.

According to Barney and Silbey, the political views of the editorial staff do not factor in to the type of submissions they are looking for. “When we are taking submissions we are not looking to flatter our political views; we are looking to put out good art,” Barney says.

_Praxis_ is also accepting more people on the editorial staff to help with layout and editing pieces.

“A lot of good people who do solid organizing in Portland got their start at Reed,” Barney says.

As _Praxis_ begins anew, its purpose is to produce art that will facilitate further discussion and self-critique within radical circles. Silbey says that, in printing the zine, they are “thinking not just about the ugliness of the world we have but the beauty of the one we want.”
