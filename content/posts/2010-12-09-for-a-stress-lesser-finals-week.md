At the end of every semester, the library has the potential of becoming a dark, dark place. It scares me and I usually don’t go near it until I need something, but this year I am hell-bent on using my thesis desk during Reading Week. So, in an effort to make this achievable, I offer to you, my fellow Reedies, advice on how to not be scary stress-consumed finals zombies. This is a selfish mission, yes – but you might just benefit, too.

**Jamie’s Ideas for a Stress-Lesser Finals Week:**

Just because the library is open for 24 hours does not mean you have to use it for 24 consecutive hours.

Take showers. The shower is where most of us have our Holy Shit Moments. Don’t deprive yourself of the HSMs.

Eat well. Don’t eat all your meals at Stim Table. Healthy foods and then if you write best with puffy Cheetos and Cherry Garcia (please forward all donations to thesis desk 191), go with what works.

When you’re studying, stand up, stretch, exercise. Take breaks. There’s science behind this, so if you don’t believe me, Google it.

Talk to your friends/significant other/parents/dog/other about things unrelated to school.

If the Internet is your main distraction, and (a) you can study without a computer, don’t take your computer to your study space, or (b) you have to use a computer, go somewhere without the Internet, or where the WiFi is password protected (this only works if you don’t ask for the password).

These places exist. I’d share my spot, but I don’t want to find a hundred Reedies there tomorrow (sorry).

Keep doing the things that make you happy. If you’re unhappy, try remembering a time when you were happy, think about what you were doing, and go do it.

Schedule in time to be a happy person.

If you couldn’t think of anything that would make you happy, Health and Counseling has drop-in hours 3-4 at the HCC (gray building north of 28 West).

Lastly, remember finals end! Celebrate!
