Reed wears its atheism proudly, and, according to Reed’s own surveys of its incoming classes, has one of the most secular student bodies in the nation. “Radical secularism in our modern western culture is bankrupting the university,” said Mary Poplin, a professor of education at Claremont Graduate School. She went on to explain that the secular nature of America’s universities today is leaving our students, first, ignorant of what the majority of the world believes. According to Poplin, only 4% of the world’s population today is atheist, adding that probably another 4% would identify as agnostic. Secondly, secularism is corrupting universities “search for truth” by cutting out the “truth” proffered by Judeo-Christian traditions. All of this, Poplin posited, leaves universities with thin, “desiccated” conversations.

Poplin spoke of her time in Calcutta working with Mother Teresa. She said that often secular Americans prefer to see Mother Teresa as an “extraordinary humanist” rather than she really was – an deeply religious person who put prayer and devotion to Jesus as her “first work of ministry.” Poplin posited that secular Americans are often “put off by her Jesus language.” Christians, in American modern media, are often portrayed as fanatical, thus casting a negative light on all Christians.

Poplin’s lecture used the example of a study done on forgiveness to illustrate the distortion of truth that comes of discrediting the influence of humans belief in God. Poplin pointed out that in one study done in what she calls “secular psychology,” there is a direct correlation in people above the age of 60 in their “rate of forgiveness” and their belief in God. The psychologists’ conclusion drawn from this study did not mention God once. This is directly related to what she called “the calamity of displacing Christianity,” and brushing it off as idiosyncratic traditions or faiths.

In conclusion, Poplin said that the question for “your generation” – meaning the generation of students now attending college – is, “if Mother Teresa’s way of life is true or even possible… Is reality secular?” She encouraged the attendees of the lecture to consider and talk more openly about how secularism – or “fear of religion” – is affecting our search for knowledge and our understanding of the world today.
