At Reed, a great deal of energy is devoted to pondering what it means for an individual to engage in honorable behavior. I would like to take an opportunity, however, to consider what it means for the student body government as an institution to act in accord with the Honor Principle. First, let me make clear that honorable policy formation is not reducible to the naïve proposition that any rule will necessarily be followed and as such that enforcement is redundant. In a community in which all the rules are always followed, there is little value in having an Honor Principle at all—such mechanical behavior deprives the individual of the decision-making, experience, and reflection that permits thoughtful engagement with the community.

An honorable student body government must constantly ask itself how its decisions affect the abilities of all community members to meaningfully engage in campus life. While academics are the primary focus at Reed, student involvement plays an important role in broadening the range of student experiences and in providing opportunities to practice decision-making. Only by confronting conflict directly can students become rigorous, independent thinkers in the best of the liberal arts tradition.

In addition to promoting honorable behavior by enabling student engagement, an honorable student body government must also transparently justify its choices. The Honor Principle asks us to consider both the intentions and effects of our actions. Analogously, Senate must weigh the process and outcomes of its decisions. From funding student organizations to deliberating on the process for handling AOD incidents, there are tradeoffs and judgment calls that must be made. Not everyone will always agree with Senate’s decisions, but the process should enable anyone to criticize Senate’s conclusions. Such disputations and creative tensions actually lead to the student involvement that makes Reed a vibrant intellectual community.

With these goals in mind, I am pleased to announce that Senate has opted to decline any food or drinks brought by signators during Funding Circus. This decision will promote accountability and represents a major step towards clearing lingering doubts about Senate’s ability to evaluate proposed budgets on their merits and on expressed student interest. I believe this is an important first measure for creating a more honorable student government and ultimately a more honorable, stronger community.
