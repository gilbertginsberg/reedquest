6:10 pm, Sitka kitchen. It is twenty minutes to show time and Bryan Nakayama ‘10 is frenzied. As his cohorts set up the aesthetic — one best characterized by knitted tablecloths and porcelain dinnerware — Nakayama is still at the counter, chopping up garlic.

“We’re not ready,” he says rather nonchalantly. “And I’ll be drunk before the end of the night.”

Behind Nakayama are piles of chopped potatoes and a brimming stovetop. To his sides are his fellow cooks, who are straining peaches and puréeing the pisto manchego (a Spanish variant of ratatouille). Reedies with appetite begin to trickle in, and Nakayama tells them that it will be about ten minutes until everything is ready. In the meantime, the masses are appeased by peach ginger soda.

Such last-minute chaos is not unexpected, though. After all, it is only the second campus-wide event held by /uncommons/, Reed’s group of fine dining specialists.

The organization, comprised of students and alumni passionate about ‘good food,’ usually serves about twelve students on a weekly basis: a stark contrast to the masses present for Saturday night’s pintxos (tapas) event.

“This was the closest we have ever gotten to how a real restaurant functions, with people ordering exactly what they want and us getting for them,” said Becca Traber, who signates the group with Chris Chapman. “This was dramatically harder than what we usually do. We weren’t seating people and we weren’t expecting this level of demand, so I think we had enough to sell out in forty-five minutes or so.”

Usually, /uncommons/ events are much smaller in scale than Saturday night’s tapas tasting. Twelve people — who must reserve a spot on their website — are selected via a lottery system and choose from a fixed menu of entrees. A typical /uncommons/ dinner can run up to seven courses and will last for up to three hours.

“We don’t usually do big events because that just isn’t our focus,” explains Nakayama, the self-proclaimed ‘spiritual leader’ of the group. “We aren’t looking to create a mass-produced dining experience.”

Nakayama founded /uncommons/ in fall 2009 with Chapman and Traber. The exact nature of the group’s genesis is a bit blurry. (To this point, there is a ‘founding myth which involves Nakayama drunkenly waking up from a dream and subsequently calling Chapman.) However, Nakayama says that supper clubs, such as those at Reed Arts Week, and a lack of fine dining choices led to the creation of
  
“We kind of wanted to stand at odds with Commons as an institution,” he said.

Nakayama was also quick to note that Bon Appetit, the food management company that caters Commons food, frequently collaborates with /uncommons/ by providing ingredients and other utilities.

Preparation for an /uncommons/ event is toilsome. The group spends anywhere from twenty to thirty hours planning, preparing, and cooking the food for any one of their dinners. For last week’s event, they began cooking at 9am on Saturday.

“We had to do things a little differently in that we had to assign people to specific roles,” Nakayama said. “It’s a much more organic process when we are cooking a large meal. Everyone kind of helps out with everything.”

“It was a total experiment for us,” Traber added.

Despite its highly specialized nature, /uncommons/ has seen enormous success.

Since its inception three semesters ago, they have placed 26th, 16th, and most recently, 2nd in the Funding Poll. For the current semester,
  
/uncommons/ was awarded $2,275 in student body funds. Nakayama says that this money goes into either capital acquisitions (such as equipment and dinnerware) or subsidizing the cost of events.

“Without funding from Senate, /uncommons/ would not have been possible,” Nakayama said. “We break even on pretty much all of our events.”

Still, this level of success for such a niche effort — which Nakayama describes as a ‘meteoric rise in popularity’ — is surprising. Aside from Funding Poll, /uncommons/ has had excellent turnouts for nearly all of their events, said a member of the group.

“I think [it’s because] Reedies really love food,” Traber said. “If you look at a lot of the other popular student groups, a good portion of them are food-related. The food that we do though, is not covered by any other student group or restaurant in the city. Sure, there are plenty of fantastic restaurants in town, but none where you can get a seven course tasting menu for cheaper than a Commons dinner.

“To the best of our knowledge, we are the only student group in the country doing something like this. And if another one exists, they’ve been hard to find word of.”
