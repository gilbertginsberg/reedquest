&#8220;Oh, look at all this greenery!&#8221; poet Sarah Kay exclaimed on-stage in the Reed Chapel. She was referring to the lushness outside, a stark contrast to the Manhattan streets she grew up on. &#8220;I&#8217;m a city kid,&#8221; she explained.

Gray Fund hosted a gripping spoken word performance by Kay last Thursday. The question-and-answer session afterward was equally lively. Students, roused by Kay&#8217;s stellar reading, plunged into their recesses of query to produce such questions as &#8220;If you had to conduct a physics lecture&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;What would you say to your twenty year old self?&#8221; The latter question stumped Kay, a twenty year old junior at Brown University only two years ago.

Kay is an increasingly renowned American poet perhaps as famous for her work in educational empowerment as for her enlivening performances around the world. Alongside Phil Kaye (no relation) Kay founded Project V.O.I.C.E., &#8220;a national movement that celebrates and inspires youth self-expression through Spoken Word Poetry&#8221;. As the Gray Fund posters around campus explain, Kay has given not one, but two TED talks, and she has used these opportunities to speak out about the inspiring fruits of her efforts with V.O.I.C.E. She is currently back at Brown working towards a masters in education. She balances touring with her masters work.

Kay&#8217;s Thursday performance began as she described her annual family vacations to Montauk, NY, and then seamlessly moulded her spoken prose into bouncing verse on the same subject. She did not miss a beat. Kay spoke a lot about family throughout the night. Her second poem was an emotional portrait of her younger brother. She joked lovingly about his dry sense of humor and love for sports.

After Kay&#8217;s second poem she asked the audience &#8220;Who here is in love?&#8221; About one-third of the audience cheered back. She said this was a litmus test for audience age. Confident that the crowd was of age to hear about more sensual topics, Kay dove into a poem about young love. This poem was a retrograde yearning into the past, a poetic analysis of long since ended, but unresolved, love.

Some of Kay&#8217;s poems explored her recent travels. The fourth poem on her line-up was a response to the question &#8220;What have you been up to lately?&#8221; This question, she said, has overwhelmed her lately because of the amount of paradigm shifting experiences she has had. The resulting poem was about India, where she spent some time in the past year. The poem included, among other splendours, a spider the size of her hand.

Returning to the subject of love and tension within love Kay recited a poem about long distance relationships. Some of the insight interwoven into the work: &#8220;practice does make perfect, practice makes permanent.&#8221; Afterword she engaged in the whimsical with a love poem between a tooth brush and a bicycle tire.

Kay touched on other, diverse topics throughout the set including South African Apartheid, friendship, and childhood teachers. Her appreciation for teachers and compassion for students are evident in her poems as well as in her between poem talk about her journeys in education. As part of her masters work Kay recently taught a highschool English class. This experience helped her answer a Reedies&#8217; post-performance question: &#8220;What is your favorite literary device?&#8221; After some hesitation, Kay said she has grown to appreciate the various forms of irony.

Kay was not much older than many of the students in attendance. In this way Kay was a self-demonstration of how labour and passion can come together dynamically in the social world. Reed students can appreciate Kay&#8217;s simultaneous work as a student and educator.
