  <em>Wyatt Alt&#8217;s &#8217;13 thesis? Counting the Number of Domino Tilings in the M x N Projective Plane.</em>
</p>

&#8220;You unlock this door with the key of imagination. Beyond it is another dimension &#8211; a dimension of sound, a dimension of sight, a dimension of mind. You&#8217;re moving into a land of both shadow and substance, of things and ideas.&#8221; You&#8217;ve just crossed over into Wyatt Alt&#8217;s thesis.

Wyatt Alt &#8217;13 is working on his Math thesis, in which he will count the number of domino tilings of the M by N projective plane, with Professor Dave Perkinson. The M x N projective plane, Wyatt explains, is &#8220;a special grid that embeds in the four dimensional plane.&#8221;

He describes the projective plane relative to a Möbius strip. A Möbius strip is a one-sided third-dimensional surface, usually represented with a strip of paper that has been twisted half a turn and joined at the ends. An M x N projective plane is similar, but instead of just the ends of the strip being joined, the edges of the strip are joined as well.

Wyatt is setting out to count the number of domino tilings on the projective plane. Since the projective plane is a grid whose squares connect at the vertices in a specific way, it is possible, for the purpose of explanation, to imagine it unfolded as a simple grid. On a grid, a domino tiling can be drawn by covering the grid in dominos so there are no empty squares. Each domino takes up two squares. However, Wyatt explains, &#8220;there are a lot more domino tilings of the projective plane than of the grid.&#8221; The projective plane is fourth-dimensional, which allows for the dominos to be wrapped around the back.

Wyatt says that a checkerboard can be represented with a graph, which, in turn, can also be represented as an adjacency matrix, or a matrix derived from the graph. Wyatt then takes the Pfaffian of the matrix, a polynomial which he uses as a determinant. Wyatt explains, &#8220;If you orient the graph the correct way, the Pfaffian will give the correct number of tilings.&#8221; The linear combination of all the Pfaffians of the projective plane will yield the total number of domino tilings.

Wyatt expects the process to take him the entire year. But for a math thesis, a project that can be completed in a year is a rare and satisfying occurrence. Says Wyatt, &#8220;I liked that this was a project that you could find the answer to.&#8221;
