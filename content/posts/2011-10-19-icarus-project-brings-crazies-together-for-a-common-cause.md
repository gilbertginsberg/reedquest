There’s one topic nobody, not even Reedies, likes to talk about: mental illness. The Reed Icarus Project is out to change that.

The Icarus Project is a mental health support group consisting of an online community and branches all across the country.  “We come together as equals who have had experiences labeled as mental illness,” said Andrew, a club member, who asked to be identified by first name only. “We talk about the experiences. Sometimes we ask each other for advice.” Any advice, though, is given with the understanding that every person’s situation is different. One of the group’s principles is that no one course of action is appropriate for everyone. As Andrew put it, the group is “&#8230;not about telling people to get on meds or off meds, to engage with therapy or not.”

Along with providing support for those struggling with their own minds, the Icarus Project works to reduce the stigma attached to mental illness. “[W]e often think about mental illness as this irrational force that we have to drive out of people,” says Andrew, adding that “a lot of people with otherwise progressive views adopt patronizing or flat-out bigoted views about mental illness.”

It is this bigotry that inspires The Icarus Project’s activism, especially around the issue of police treatment of those perceived as mentally ill. Andrew remembers the case of a Reedie who “was tazed and pepper-sprayed by [the] police during a mental health crisis,” which, Andrew added sarcastically, is “okay, as long as he was _really_ crazy, you know?”

Reedies habitually tackle difficult issues. Racism, sexism, homophobia and sexual assault are all discussed openly on campus, with new students participating in talks and break-out groups during O-Week and activist groups meeting throughout the year. Why, then, do Reedies shy away from the topic of mental illness?

The Icarus Project doesn’t think we have to. Now that the group has made the Funding Poll Top 40, they hope to bring speakers to campus to talk about mental illness and change the way Reedies, and maybe comunity members at large, think about mental illness.

The “crazies”, as members of the Reed branch affectionately call each other, meet weekly, sometimes on Mondays, sometimes on Wednesdays, in the Blue Heron Infoshop.
